<abstract>
<t>
  This specification extends RFC6550 and RFC8505 to provide unicast and
  multicast routing services to Hosts which do not speak RPL.
  These hosts, called RPL Unaware Leaves (RUN) do not participate to RPL
  directly.  Such hosts may be unable to participate because they are very
  energy constrained.  This specification enables the RPL Root to proxy the EDAR/EDAC
  flow on behalf of the RULs and RANs in its DODAG.

<section anchor='introduction'><name>Introduction</name>

<t>The design of Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) is generally focused on
   saving energy, which is the most constrained resource of all. Other design
   constraints, such as a limited memory capacity, duty cycling of the LLN
   devices and low-power lossy transmissions, derive from that primary concern.
</t>


<t>The IETF produced the <xref target='RFC6550'>"Routing Protocol for Low Power
   and Lossy Networks"</xref> (RPL) to provide IPv6 <xref target='RFC8200'/>
   routing services within such constraints. RPL belongs to the class of
   Distance-Vector protocol, which, compared to link-state protocols,
   limits the amount of topological knowledge that needs to be installed and
   maintained in each node.
</t>
<t> In order to operate in constrained networks,
   RPL allows a routing stretch (see <xref target='RFC6687'/>), whereby routing
   is only performed along an acyclic graph optimized to reach a Root node,
   as opposed to straight along a shortest path
   between 2 peers, whatever that would mean in a given LLN.
   This trades the quality of peer-to-peer (P2P) paths for a vastly reduced
   amount of control traffic and routing state that would be required to
   operate a any-to-any shortest path protocol.
   Finally, broken routes may be fixed lazily and on-demand, based on dataplane
   inconsistency discovery, which avoids wasting energy in the proactive repair
   of unused paths.

</t><t>
   In order to cope with lossy transmissions, RPL forms Direction-Oriented
   Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs) using DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS)
   and DODAG Information Object (DIO) messages. For many of the nodes, though
   not all, a DODAG provides multiple forwarding solutions towards the Root of
   the topology via so-called parents.
   RPL is designed to adapt to fuzzy connectivity, whereby the physical topology
   cannot be expected to reach a stable state, with a lazy control that creates
   the routes proactively, but may only fix them reactively, upon actual traffic.
   The result is that RPL provides reachability for most of the LLN nodes, most
   of the time, but may not converge in the classical sense.
</t>
<t>
   <xref target='RFC6550'/> provides unicast and multicast routing services
   back to RPL-Aware nodes (RANs), either as a collection tree or with routing
   back. In that latter case, a RAN injects routes to itself using Destination
   Advertisement Object (DAO) messages sent to either parent-nodes in the RPL
   Storing Mode or to the Root indicating their parent in the Non-Storing Mode.
   This process effectively forms a DODAG back to the device that is a subset of
   the DODAG to the Root with all links reversed.
</t>
<t>
  This specification leverages some of the Non-Storing Mode mechanisms to
  extend the routing database with connectivity to unaware leaves.
  These Non-Storing Mode mechanisms are still used in Storing-Mode DODAGs.
</t>
<t>
   RPL can be deployed as an extension to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)
   <xref target='RFC4861'/><xref target='RFC4862'/> and 6LoWPAN ND
   <xref target='RFC6775'/><xref target='RFC8505'/> to maintain reachability
   within a Non-Broadcast Multi-Access (NBMA) subnet.
   In that mode, some nodes may act as Routers and
   participate to the forwarding operations whereas others will only terminate
   packets, acting as Hosts in the data-plane.
   In <xref target='RFC6550'/> terms, a Host that is reachable over the RPL
   network is called a Leaf.
</t>
<t>
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'>
   "When to use RFC 6553, 6554 and IPv6-in-IPv6"</xref> introduces the term
   RPL-Aware-Leaf (RAL) for a Leaf that injects routes in RPL to manage the
   reachability of its own IPv6 addresses.
   In contrast, the term RPL-Unaware Leaf (RUL) designates a Leaf that does not
   participate to RPL at all. A RUL is a plain <xref target="RFC8504" /> Host that needs a
   RPL-Aware Router to obtain routing services over the RPL network.
</t>
<t>
   This specification leverages the Address Registration mechanism defined in
   6LoWPAN ND to enable a RUL as a 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) to interface with a
   RPL-Aware Router as a 6LoWPAN Router (6LR) to request that the 6LR injects
   the relevant routing information for the Registered Address in the RPL domain
   on its behalf.
   The unicast packet forwarding operation by the 6LR serving a 6LN that is a
   RPL Leaf is described in <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/>.
</t>
<t>
   Examples of routing-agnostic 6LNs include lightly-powered sensors such as
   window smash sensor (alarm system), and kinetically powered light switches.
   Other application of this specification may include a smart grid network that
   controls appliances - such as washing machines or the heating system - in the
   home. Appliances may not participate to the RPL protocol operated in the
   Smartgrid network but can still interact with the Smartgrid for control and/or
   metering.

<section anchor='R6775'><name>RFC 6775 Address Registration</name>

<t>
   The classical "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) Protocol"
   <xref target='RFC4861'/> <xref target='RFC4862'/> was defined for transit
   media such a Ethernet. It is a reactive protocol that relies heavily on
   multicast operations for address discovery (aka lookup) and duplicate
   address detection (DAD).
</t><t>
   <xref target='RFC6775'>
   "Neighbor Discovery Optimizations for 6LoWPAN networks"</xref>
   adapts IPv6 ND for operations over energy-constrained LLNs.
   The main functions of <xref target='RFC6775'/> are to proactively establish
   the Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) in the 6LR and to prevent address duplication.
   To that effect, <xref target='RFC6775'/> introduces a new unicast Address
   Registration  mechanism that contributes to reducing the use of multicast
   messages compared to the classical IPv6 ND protocol.

</t><t><xref target='RFC6775'/> defines a new Address
   Registration Option (ARO) that is carried in the unicast
   Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages between
   the 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) and the 6LoWPAN Router (6LR).

   It also defines the Duplicate Address Request (DAR) and Duplicate
   Address Confirmation (DAC) messages between the 6LR and the 6LoWPAN Border
   Router (6LBR).
   In an LLN, the 6LBR is the central repository of all the Registered Addresses
   in its domain and the source of truth for uniqueness and ownership.

<section anchor='R8505ER'><name>R Flag</name>
<t>
<xref target='RFC8505'/> introduces the "R" flag in the EARO.
   The Registering Node sets the "R" flag to indicate whether the 6LR should
   ensure reachability for the Registered Address.
   If the "R" flag is not set, then the Registering Node handles the reachability
   of the Registered Address by other means, which means in a RPL network that
   it is a RAN or that it uses another RPL Router for reachability services.
</t><t>
   This document specifies how the "R" flag is used in the context of RPL. A 6LN
   is a RUL that requires reachability services for an IPv6 address iff it sets
   the "R" flag in the EARO used to register the address to a RPL router.
   Conversely, this document specifies the behavior of a RPL Router acting as
   6LR depending on the setting of the "R" flag in the EARO.
   The RPL Router generates a DAO message for the
   Registered Address upon an NS(EARO) iff the "R" flag is set.
</t>

</section> <!-- end section "R Flag" -->
<section anchor='R8505ETID'><name>TID, I Field and Opaque Fields</name>

<t>
   The EARO also includes a sequence counter called Transaction ID (TID),
   which maps to the Path Sequence Field found in Transit Options in RPL DAO
   messages. This is the reason why the support of <xref target='RFC8505'/>
   by the RUL as opposed to only <xref target='RFC6775'/> is a prerequisite for
   this specification (more in <xref target='prereq6lp'/>). The EARO also
   transports an Opaque field and an "I" field that describes what the Opaque
   field transports and how to use it. <xref target='ln'/> specifies the use of
   the "I" field and of the Opaque field by a RUL.
</t>

</section> <!-- end section "TID, I Field and Opaque Fields" -->
<section anchor='R8505EROVR'><name>ROVR</name>
<t>
   Section 5.3. of <xref target='RFC8505'/> introduces the Registration
   Ownership Verifier (ROVR) field of variable length from 64 to 256 bits.
   <!-- A ROVR is created by the Registering Node and associated to the Address Registration
   of an IPv6 Address. -->
   The ROVR is a replacement of the EUI-64 in the ARO
   <xref target='RFC6775'/> that was used to identify uniquely an Address
   Registration with the Link-Layer address of the owner, but provided no
   protection against spoofing.
</t><t>

   <xref target='I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd'>"Address Protected Neighbor Discovery for
   Low-power and Lossy Networks"</xref> leverages the ROVR field as a
   cryptographic proof of ownership to prevent a rogue third party from misusing
   the address.
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd'/> adds a challenge/response exchange to the
   <xref target='RFC8505'/> Address Registration and enables Source Address Validation
   by a 6LR that will drop packets with a spoofed address.
</t><t>

   This specification does not address how the protection by
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd'/> could be extended to RPL. On the other
   hand, it adds the ROVR to the DAO to build the proxied EDAR at the Root
   (see <xref target='tgt'/>),
   which means that nodes that are aware of the Host route to the 6LN are made
   aware of the associated ROVR as well.
</t>

</section> <!-- end section "ROVR" -->

</section> <!-- end section "RFC 8505 Extended ARO" -->
<section anchor='R8505D'><name>RFC 8505 Extended DAR/DAC</name>
<t>
   <xref target='RFC8505'/> updates the periodic DAR/DAC exchange that takes
   place between the 6LR and the 6LBR using Extended DAR/DAC messages which can
   carry a ROVR field of variable size.
   The periodic EDAR/EDAC exchange is triggered by a NS(EARO)
   message and is intended to create and then refresh the corresponding state in
   the 6LBR for a lifetime that is indicated by the 6LN.

</t><t>
   Conversely, RPL
   <xref target='RFC6550'/> specifies a periodic DAO from the 6LN all the way to
   the Root that maintains the routing state in the RPL network for the lifetime
   indicated by the source of the DAO.
   This means that for each address, there are two keep-alive messages
   that traverse the whole network, one to the Root and one to the 6LBR.
</t><t>

   This specification removes the extraneous keep-alive across the LLN. The 6LR
   turns the periodic Address Registration from the RUL into a DAO message to
   the Root on every refresh, but it only generates the EDAR upon the first registration, for the purpose of DAD.
   Upon a refresher DAO, the Root proxies the EDAR exchange to refresh the state at the 6LBR on behalf of the 6LR, as illustrated in <xref target='fReg2'/>.
</t>

<section anchor='upd'><name>Updating RFC 6550</name>
<t>
   This document specifies a new behavior whereby a 6LR injects DAO messages
   for unicast addresses (see <xref target='op'/>) and multicast addresses
   (see <xref target='multiop'/>) on behalf of leaves that are not aware of RPL.
   The addresses are exposed as external targets <xref target='RFC6550'/>.
   Per
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/>, an IP-in-IP encapsulation that
   terminates at the RPL Root is used to remove RPL artifacts and compression
   techniques that may not be processed correctly outside of the RPL domain.

</t><t>
   This document also synchronizes the liveness monitoring at the Root and the
   6LBR. A same value of lifetime is used for both, and a single keep-alive
   message, the RPL DAO, traverses the RPL network. A new behavior is introduced
   whereby the RPL Root proxies the EDAR message to the 6LBR on behalf of the
   6LR (more in <xref target='upd2'/>), for any 6LN, RUL or RAN.

</t><t>
   RPL defines a configuration option that is registered to
   IANA in section 20.14. of <xref target='RFC6550'/>. This specification
   defines a new flag "Root Proxies EDAR/EDAC" (P) that is encoded in
   one of the reserved control bits in the option. The new flag is set to
   indicate that the Root performs the proxy operation and that all nodes in
   the network must refrain from renewing the 6LBR state directly. The bit
   position of the "P" flag is indicated in <xref target='iana-conf'/>.

</t><t>
   Section 6.3.1.
   of <xref target='RFC6550'/> defines a 3-bit Mode of Operation (MOP) in the
   DIO Base Object. The new "P" flag is defined only for MOP value between 0 to
   6. For a MOP value of 7 or above, the flag MAY indicate something different
   and MUST NOT be interpreted as "Root Proxies EDAR/EDAC" unless the
   specification of the MOP indicates to do so.

</t><t>
   The RPL Status defined in section 6.5.1. of <xref target="RFC6550"/>
   for use in the DAO-Ack message is extended to be used in the DCO messages
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-efficient-npdao'/> as well. Furthermore, this
   specification enables to use a RPL Status to transport the IPv6 ND Status
   defined for use in the EARO, more in <xref target='stat'/>.

</t><t>

<t>

   This document updates <xref target='RFC8505'/> to introduce the anonymous
   EDAR and NS(EARO) messages. The anonymous messages are used for backward
   compatibility. The anonymous messages are recognizable by a zero ROVR
   field and can only be used as a refresher for a pre-existing state associated
   to the Registered Address. More specifically, an anonymous message can only
   increase the lifetime and/or increment the TID of an existing state at the
   6LBR.
</t><t>
   Upon the renewal of a 6LoWPAN ND Address Registration, this specification
   changes the behavior of a RPL Router acting as 6LR for the registration. If
   the Root indicates the capability to proxy the EDAR/EDAC exchange to the 6LBR
   then the 6LR refrains from sending an EDAR message; if the Root is separated
   from the 6LBR, the Root regenerates the EDAR message to the 6LBR upon a DAO
   message that signals the liveliness of the Address. The regenerated message
   is anonymous iff the DAO is a legacy message that does not carry a ROVR as
   specified in <xref target='tgt'/>.

<section anchor='prereq'><name>Requirements on the RPL-Unware Leaf</name>
<t>
   This document provides RPL routing for a RUL, that is a 6LN acting as an IPv6
   Host and not aware of RPL. Still, a minimal RPL-independent functionality is
   required from the RUL in order to obtain routing services from the 6LR.
</t>
 <section anchor='prereq6lp'><name>Support of 6LoWPAN ND</name>
<t>
   In order to obtain routing services from a 6LR, a RUL MUST implement
   <xref target='RFC8505'/>. Such a RUL that receives a CIO from a potential
   (6LR) router that has the L, P and E flags set, SHOULD set the "R" flag in
   the EARO in order to request routing services from that 6LR.
   and set the "R" flag in the EARO option.
   This is detailed in in <xref target='R7400'/>

   A RUL that has multiple potential routers SHOULD prefer the router that
   can provide the desired routing services.
   If there are no available routers, the connection of the RUL fails.

</t>
<t>
   The RUL MUST register to all the 6LRs from which it requests routing services.
   The Address Registrations SHOULD be performed in a rapid sequence, using the
   exact same EARO for a same Address. Gaps between the Address Registrations
   will invalidate some of the routes till the Address Registration finally
   shows on those routes as well.
</t>

<t><xref target='RFC8505'/> introduces error Status values in the NA(EARO)
   which can be received synchronously upon an NS(EARO) or asynchronously. The
   RUL MUST support both cases and MUST refrain from using the address
   when the Status value indicates a rejection.

</t><t>
   A RUL SHOULD support <xref target='I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd'/> to protect the
   ownership of its addresses.

</t>

</section> <!-- end section "Support of 6LoWPAN ND" -->
<section anchor='prereqv6'><name>External Routes and RPL Artifacts</name>

<t>
   Section 4.1. of <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/> provides a set of
   rules that MUST be followed for the routing operations to a RUL.
</t><t>
   A 6LR that is upgraded to act as a border router for external routes
   advertises them using  Non-Storing Mode DAO messages that are unicast
   directly to the Root, even if the DODAG is operated in Storing Mode.
   Non-Storing Mode routes are not visible inside the RPL domain and all packets
   are routed via the Root. An upgraded Root tunnels the packets directly to the
   6LR that advertised the external route which decapsulates and forwards the
   original (inner) packet.
</t><t>
   The RPL Non-Storing Mode signaling and the associated IP-in-IP encapsulated
   packets are normal traffic for the intermediate Routers. The support
   of external routes only impacts the Root and the 6LR. It can be operated with
   legacy intermediate routers and does not add to the amount of state that must
   be maintained in those routers.
   A RUL is an example of a destination that is reachable via an external route
   which happens to be a Host route.
</t><t>
   The RPL data packets always carry a Hop-by-Hop Header to transport a RPL
   Packet Information (RPI) <xref target='RFC6550'/>.
   So unless the RUL originates its packets with an RPI, the 6LR needs to tunnel
   them to the Root to add the RPI. As a rule of a thumb and except for the very
   special case above, the packets from and to a RUL are always encapsulated
   using an IP-in-IP tunnel between the Root and the 6LR that serves the RUL.
   (see sections 7.1.4, 7.2.3, 7.2.4, 7.3.3, 7.3.4, 8.1.3, 8.1.4, 8.2.3,
   8.2.4, 8.3.3 and 8.3.4 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/> for details)
</t><t>
   In Non-Storing Mode, packets going down carry a Source Routing Header (SRH).
   The IP-in-IP encapsulation, the RPI and the SRH are collectively called the
   "RPL artifacts" and can be compressed using <xref target='RFC8138'/>.
   <xref target='rtghc'/> presents an example compressed format for a packet
   forwarded by the Root to a RUL in a Storing Mode DODAG.
</t><t>
   The inner packet that is forwarded to the RUL may carry some RPL artifacts,
   e.g., an RPI if the original packet was generated with it and encapsulated by
   the Root with that RPI still present in the inner header, and possibly an SRH
   in a Non-Storing Mode DODAG.
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/> expects the RUL to support the
   basic <xref target='RFC8504'>"IPv6 Node Requirements"</xref>.
   In particular the RUL is expected to ignore the RPL artifacts that are
   either consumed or not applicable to a Host.
   Such a host may not necessarily ignore IP-in-IP encapsulation, which is
   dealt with below.

</t><t>
   A RUL is not expected to support the compression method defined in
   <xref target='RFC8138'/>. Unless configured otherwise, the border
   router MUST uncompress the outgoing packet before forwarding over an external
   route, even if it is not the destination of the incoming packet, and even
   when delivering to a RUL.

</t>
<section anchor='prereqv6ip'><name>Support of IPv6 Encapsulation</name>

<t>
   Section 2.1 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/> sets the rules
   for forwarding IP-in-IP either to the final 6LN or to a parent 6LR.
   In order to enable IP-in-IP to the 6LN in Non-Storing Mode, the 6LN must be
   able to decapsulate the tunneled packet and either drop the inner packet if
   it is not the final destination, or pass it to the upper layer for further
   processing. Unless it is aware that the RUL can handle IP-in-IP properly, the
   Root that encapsulates a packet to a RUL terminates the IP-in-IP tunnel at
   the parent 6LR . For that reason, it is beneficial but not necessary for a
   RUL to support IP-in-IP.
</t>

    <t>The RPL Status is defined in section 6.5.1. of <xref target="RFC6550"/>
    for use in the DAO-Ack message and values are assigned as follows:</t>

   <table anchor="irplStatusbl"><name>RPL Status per RFC 6550</name>

    <t>
    This specification extends the scope of the RPL Status to be used in RPL DCO
    messages. Furthermore, this specification enables to carry the IPv6 ND
    Status values defined for use in the EARO and initially listed in table 1

   Conversely, the 6LR MUST copy the value of the RPL Status unchanged in the

<t>
  The description below assumes that the Root sets the "P" flag in the
  DODAG Configuration Option and performs the EDAR proxy operation.
</t>

<section anchor='flow'><name>General Flow</name>

  <t>
   This specification eliminates the need to exchange keep-alive Extended
   Duplicate Address messages, EDAR and EDAC, all the way from a 6LN to the 6LBR
   across a RPL mesh. Instead, the EDAR/EDAC exchange with the 6LBR is proxied
   by the RPL Root upon a DAO message that refreshes the RPL routing state.

 </t><t>
   To achieve this, the lifetimes and
   sequence counters in 6LoWPAN ND and RPL are aligned. In other words, the Path
   Sequence and the Path Lifetime in the DAO message are taken from the
   Transaction ID and the Address Registration lifetime in the NS(EARO) message
   from the 6LN.

 </t><t>
   The proxy operation applies to both RULs and RANs. In a RPL
   network where the function is enabled, refreshing the state in the 6LBR is
   the responsibility of the Root. Consequently, only addresses that are
   injected in RPL will be kept alive by the RPL Root. </t><t>
   In a same fashion, if an additional routing
   protocol is deployed on a same network, that additional routing protocol may
   need to handle the keep alive procedure for the addresses that it serves.

</t><t>
   On the first Address Registration, illustrated in <xref target='fReg1'/>
   and <xref target='fReg2bis'/> for RPL Non-Storing and Storing Mode
   respectively, the Extended Duplicate Address exchange takes place as
   prescribed by <xref target='RFC8505'/>. Any of the functions 6LR, Root and
   6LBR might be collapsed in a single node.

</t><t>

   When successful, the flow creates a Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) in the 6LR,
   and the 6LR injects the Registered Address in RPL using DAO/DAO-ACK
   exchanges all the way to the RPL DODAG Root.
   The protocol does not carry a specific information that the Extended
   Duplicate Address messages were already exchanged, so the Root proxies
   them anyway.
 </t>
 <section anchor='rnsm'><name>In RPL Non-Storing-Mode</name>

    Target Option. In both cases, the EDAC message sent in response by the 6LBR
    contains the actual value of the ROVR field for that Address Registration.
    In case of an error on the proxied EDAR flow, the error MUST be
    returned in the DAO-ACK - if one was requested - using a RPL Status with the 'A' flag set that imbeds a 6LoWPAN Status value as discussed in <xref target='stat'/>.

 </t> <t>
    If the Root could not return the negative Status in the DAO-ACK then it
    sends an asynchronous Destination Cleanup Object (DCO) message
    <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-efficient-npdao'/> to the 6LR by placing the
    negative Status in the RPL Status with the 'A' flag set. Note that if both
    are used in a short
    interval of time, the DAO-ACK and DCO messages are not guaranteed to arrive
    in the same order at the 6LR.

 </t> <t>
    The 6LR may still receive a requested DAO-ACK even after it received a
    DCO, but the negative Status in the DCO supercedes a positive
    Status in the DAO-ACK regardless of the order in which they are received.
    Upon the DAO-ACK - or the DCO if it arrives first - the 6LR responds to the
    RUL with a NA(EARO). If the RPL Status has the 'A' flag set, then the ND
    Status is extracted and passed in the EARO; else, if the 'E' flag is set,
    indicating a rejection, then the status 4 "Removed" is used; else, the
    ND Status of 0 indicating "Success" is used.
</t>

<t>
  In RPL Storing Mode, the DAO-ACK is optional. When it is used, it is generated
  by the RPL parent, which does not need to wait for the grand-parent to send
  the acknowledgement. A successful DAO-ACK is not a guarantee that the DAO
  has yet reached the Root or that the EDAR has succeeded.

<section anchor='oper'><name>Detailed Operation</name>


<section anchor='ln'><name>By the 6LN</name>
<t>
  This specification does not alter the operation of a 6LoWPAN ND-compliant 6LN,
  and a RUL is expected to operate as follows:
</t><ul spacing='normal'><li>
   The 6LN obtains an IPv6 global address, either using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) <xref target='RFC4862'/> based on a Prefix
   Information Option (PIO) <xref target='RFC4861'/> found in a Router
   Advertisement message, or some other means such as DHCPv6
   <xref target='RFC3315'/>.

</li><li>
   Once it has formed an address, the 6LN (re)registers its address periodically,
   within the Lifetime of the previous Address Registration, as prescribed by
<xref target='RFC6775'/> and <xref target='RFC8505'/>.
</li><li>
   As stated in section 5.2 of <xref target='RFC8505'/>, the 6LN can register
   to more than one 6LR at the same time. In that case, it
   MUST use the same value of TID for all of the parallel Address Registrations.

</li><li>
   Following section 5.1 of <xref target='RFC8505'/>,
   a 6LN acting as a RUL sets the "R" flag in the EARO of at least one
   registration, whereas acting as a RAN it never does.
   If the "R" flag is set in the NS but not echoed in the NA, the RUL SHOULD
   attempt to use another 6LR.

</li><li>
   Upon each consecutive Address Registration, the 6LN increases the TID field in the
   EARO, as prescribed by <xref target='RFC8505'/> section 5.2.


</li><li>
   The 6LN may use any of the 6LRs to which it register to forward its packets.
   Using a 6LR to which the 6LN is not registered may result in packets dropped
   at the 6LR by a Source Address Validation function (SAVI) so it is NOT RECOMMENDED.
</li>

</ul><t>
</t>

<t>
   Even without support for RPL, a RUL may be aware of opaque values to be
   provided to the routing protocol. If the RUL has a knowledge of the RPL
   Instance the packet should be injected into, then it SHOULD set the Opaque
   field in the EARO to the RPLInstanceID, else it MUST leave the Opaque field
   to zero.
</t>
<t>
   Regardless of the setting of the Opaque field, the 6LN MUST set the "I"
   field to zero to signal "topological information to be passed to a routing
   process" as specified in section 5.1 of <xref target='RFC8505'/>.
</t><t>
   A RUL is not expected to produce RPL artifacts in the data packets, but it
   MAY do so. For instance, if the RUL has a minimal awareness of the RPL
   Instance then it can build an RPI. A RUL that places an RPI in a data packet
   MUST indicate the RPLInstanceID that corresponds to the RPL Instance the
   packet should be injected into. All the flags and the Rank field are set
   to zero as specified by section 11.2 of <xref target='RFC6550'/>.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor='lr'><name>By the 6LR</name>
<t>
   Also as prescribed by <xref target='RFC8505'/>,
   the 6LR generates an EDAR message upon reception of a valid NS(EARO)
   message for the Address Registration of a new IPv6 Address by a 6LN. If the Duplicate
   Address exchange succeeds, then the 6LR installs an NCE.
   If the "R" flag was set in the EARO of the NS message, and this 6LR can
   manage the reachability of Registered Address, then the 6LR sets the "R" flag
   in the EARO of the NA message that is sends in response.
</t>

<t>From then on, the 6LN periodically sends a new NS(EARO) to refresh the NCE
   state before the lifetime indicated in the EARO expires, with a TID that is
   incremented each time till it wraps in a lollipop fashion (see section 5.2.1
   of <xref target='RFC8505'/> which is fully compatible with section 7.2 of
<xref target='RFC6550'/>). As long as the "R"
   flag is set and this Router can still manage the reachability of Registered
   Address, the 6LR keeps setting the "R" flag in the EARO of the response NA
   message, but the exchange of keep-alive Extended Duplicate Address messages
   with the 6LBR is avoided if the RPL Root has indicated that it proxies for it.

</t> <t>
   The Opaque field in the EARO hints the 6LR on the RPL Instance that should
   be used for the DAO advertisements, and for the forwarding of packets sourced
   at the registered address when there is no RPI in the packet, in which case
   the 6LR MUST encapsulate the packet to the Root adding an RPI in the
   outer header.
   If the Opaque field is zero, the 6LR is free to use the default RPL Instance
   (zero) for the registered address or to select an Instance of its choice.
</t> <t>
   if the "I" field is not zero, then the 6LR MUST consider that the Opaque
   field is zero. If the Opaque field is not zero, then it is expected to
   carry a RPLInstanceID for the RPL Instance suggested by the 6LN.
   If the 6LR does not participate to the associated Instance, then the 6LR MUST
   consider that the Opaque field is zero;
   else, that is if the 6LR participates to the suggested Instance, then the
   6LR SHOULD use that Instance for the registered address.
</t>
<t>
  The DAO message advertising the Registered Address MUST be constructed as
  follows:
  </t><ol spacing='normal'>
  <li>The Registered Address is placed in an RPL Target Option in the DAO
  message as the Target Prefix, and the Prefix Length is set to 128;
  </li><li>
  RPL Non-Storing Mode is to be used. The 6LR indicates one of its global or unique-local IPv6 unicast addresses as the Parent Address in the associated RPL Transit Information Option (TIO).
  </li><li>
  the External 'E' flag in the TIO is set to indicate that the 6LR redistributes
  an external target into the RPL network.  <!--When the Root has to use an IP-in-IP
  <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/>, then this flag indicates the
  IP-in-IP should be addressed to this 6LR;-->

  </li><li>
  the Path Lifetime in the TIO is computed from the Lifetime in the EARO
  Option. This adapts it to the Lifetime Units used in the RPL operation.
  Note that if the lifetime is 0, then the 6LR generates a No-Path DAO
  message that cleans up the routes down to the Address of the 6LN;
  </li><li>
  the Path Sequence in the TIO is set to the TID value found in the EARO option;
  </li><li>
  Upon seeing the EARO in the ND with the "R" flag was set, the 6LR SHOULD
  inject the Registered Address in RPL by sending a DAO message on behalf of
  the 6LN. If the Registration Lifetime was 0, the effect is to remove the route and
  then the NCE;
</li>
  </ol><t>
</t>
<t>
   If for whatever reason the 6LR does not inject the Registered Address in RPL,
   it MUST send an NA(EARO) back with the appropriate status and the "R" flag
   not set.
</t>
<t>
   If the 6LR injects the Registered Address in RPL and either a DAO-ACK was not
   requested or is received with a RPL Status that is not a rejection ("E" flag
   not set), the 6LR MUST install or refresh the NCE for the address and reply
   to the RUL with an NA(EARO) with a Status of 0 (Success) and the "R" flag set.
</t>
<t>
   In case of a DAO-ACK or a DCO indicating transporting an EARO
   Status Value of 5 (Validation Requested), a 6LR that supports
   Address Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND) MUST
   challenge the 6LN for ownership of the address, as described in section
   6.1 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd'/>. If the challenge succeeds then
   the operations continue as normal. In particular a DAO message is generated
   upon the NS(EARO) that proves the ownership of the address. If the challenge
   failed, the 6LR rejects the registration as prescribed by AP-ND and may take
   actions to protect itself against DoS attacks by a rogue 6LN, see
   <xref target='security-considerations'/>. If the 6LR does not
   support AP-ND, it MUST send an NA to the 6LN with a Status of 0 (Success) and
   the "R" flag not set.
</t>
<t>
   The other rejection codes indicate that the 6LR failed to inject the address
   into the RPL network. If an EARO Status is transported, the 6LR MUST send a
   NA(EARO) to the RUL with that Status value, and the "R" flag not set. Similarly, upon receiving a DCO message indicating that the address of a RUL
   should be removed from the routing table, the 6LR issues an asynchronous NA(EARO) to the RUL with the embedded ND Status value if there was one, and
   the "R" flag not set.
</t>
<t>

   If a 6LR receives a valid NS(EARO) message with the "R" flag reset and a
   Registration Lifetime that is not 0, and the 6LR
   was redistributing the Registered Address due to previous NS(EARO) messages
   with the flag set, then it MUST stop injecting the address.
   It is up to the Registering 6LN to maintain the corresponding route from then
   on, either keeping it active via a different 6LR or by acting as a RAN and
   managing its own reachability.

</t>

</section>

<section anchor='Root'><name>By the RPL Root</name>


<t>
   In RPL Storing Mode of Operation (MOP), the DAO message is propagated from
   child to parent all the way to the Root along the DODAG, populating routing
   state as it goes. In Non-Storing Mode, The DAO message is sent directly to the
   RPL Root.
   Upon reception of a DAO message, for each RPL Target option that creates or
   updates an existing RPL state:
</t><ul spacing='normal'>
<li>
   the Root notifies the 6LBR using an internal API if they are co-located, or
   using a proxied EDAR/EDAC exchange if they are separated. If the RPL Target
   option transports a ROVR, then the Root MUST use it to build
   a full EDAR message; else, an anonymous EDAR is used with
   the ROVR field set to zero.
</li>
<!--t>
   In a topology where the RPL Root and the 6LBR are directly connected at the
   Link-Layer, the Root may refresh the 6LBR with an NS(EARO) - respectively an
   anonymous NS(EARO) - on behalf of the 6LN that owns the address indicated in
   the Target Option as opposed to an EDAR - respectively an anonymous EDAR -
   on behalf of the 6LR.
</t-->
</ul><t>
</t><t>
  The EDAR <!--and the NS(EARO)--> message MUST be constructed as follows:
  </t><ul spacing='normal'>
  <li>
  The Target IPv6 address from the RPL Target Option is placed in the
  Registered Address field of the EDAR message;
  <!--and in the Target field of the NS message, respectively-->
  </li><li>
  the Registration Lifetime is adapted from the Path Lifetime in the TIO by
  converting the Lifetime Units used in RPL into units of 60 seconds used in the
  6LoWPAN ND messages;
  </li><li>
  <!--
  the RPL Root indicates its own MAC Address as Source Link Layer Address (SLLA)
  in the NS(EARO);
  </li><li>
  -->
  the TID value is set to the Path Sequence in the TIO and indicated with an ICMP
  code of 1 in the EDAR message;
  </li><li>
  If the ROVR is present in the RPL Target option, it is copied as is in the
  EDAR and the ICMP Code Suffix is set to the appropriate value as shown in
  Table 4 of <xref target='RFC8505'/> depending on the size of the ROVR field;
  else, the ROVR field in the EDAR is set to zero indicating an anonymous EDAR.
  <!-- and used in the proxy NS(EARO).-->
  </li>
  </ul><t>
</t>

<t>
  Upon a Status value in an EDAC message that is not "Success", the Root SHOULD
  destroy the formed paths using either a DAO-ACK (in Non-Storing Mode) or a DCO
  downwards as specified in <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-efficient-npdao'/>.
  Failure to destroy the former path would result in Stale routing state and
  local black holes if the address belongs to another party elsewhere in the
  network. The RPL Status value that maps the 6LoWPAN ND Status value MUST be
  embedded in the RPL Status in the DCO.
</t>


</section>

<section anchor='lbr'><name>By the 6LBR</name>


<t>
   Upon reception of an EDAR message with the ROVR field is set to zero
   indicating an anonymous EDAR, the 6LBR checks whether an entry exists for the
   and computes whether the TID in the DAR message is fresher than that in the
   entry as prescribed in section 4.2.1. of <xref target='RFC8505'/>.

</t><t>
   If the entry does not exist, the 6LBR does not create the entry, and answers
   with a Status "Removed" in the EDAC message.
   If the entry exists but is not fresher, the 6LBR does not update the entry,
   and answers with a Status "Success" in the EDAC message.
</t><t>
   If the entry exists and the TID in the DAR message is fresher, the 6LBR
   updates the TID in the entry, and if the
   lifetime of the entry is extended by the Registration Lifetime in the DAR
   message, it also updates the lifetime of the entry.
   In that case, the 6LBR replies with a Status "Success" in the DAC message.
</t><t>
   The EDAC that is constructed is the same as if the anonymous EDAR was a full
   EDAR, and includes the ROVR that is associated to the Address Registration.

<section anchor='multiop'><name>Protocol Operations for Multicast Addresses</name>

 <t> Section 12 of <xref target='RFC6550'/> details the RPL support for
    multicast flows. This support is not source-specific and only operates as
    an extension to the Storing Mode of Operation for unicast packets. Note that
    it is the RPL model that the multicast packet is passed as a Layer-2 unicast
    to each if the interested children.
    This remains true when forwarding between the 6LR and the listener 6LN.
 </t>
 <t>
 <xref target='RFC2710'>"Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6"</xref>
    and its updated version <xref target='RFC3810'>
    "Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6"</xref> provide an
    interface for a listener to register to multicast flows.
    MLDv2 is backwards compatible with MLD, and adds in particular the
    capability to filter the sources via black lists and white lists.
    In the MLD model, the Router is a "querier" and the Host is a multicast
    listener that registers to the querier to obtain copies of the particular
    flows it is interested in.


 </t><t>
     On the first Address Registration, as illustrated in <xref target='fReg3'/>, the
     6LN, as an MLD listener, sends an unsolicited Report to the 6LR in order to
     start receiving the flow immediately. Since multicast Layer-2 messages are
     avoided, it is important that the asynchronous messages for unsolicited
     Report and Done are sent reliably, for instance using an Layer-2
     acknoledgement, or attempted multiple times.

     The 6LR acts as a generic MLD querier and generates a DAO for the multicast
     target. The lifetime of the DAO is set to be in the order of the Query
     Interval, yet larger to account for variable propagation delays.

 </t><t>
     The Root proxies the MLD exchange as a listener with the 6LBR acting as the
     querier, so as to get packets from a source external to the RPL domain.
     Upon a DAO with a multicast target, the RPL Root checks if it is
     already registered as a listener for that address, and if not, it performs
     its own unsolicited Report for the multicast target.
 </t>
 <t>
    An Address re-Registration is pulled periodically by 6LR acting as querier.
    Note that the message may be sent unicast to all the known individual
    listeners. Upon a
    time out of the Query Interval, the 6LR sends a Query to each of its
    listeners, and gets a Report back that is mapped into a DAO, as illustrated
    in <xref target='fReg4'/>:

 <t>Note that any of the functions 6LR, Root and 6LBR might be collapsed in a
    single node, in which case the flow above happens internally, and possibly
    through internal API calls as opposed to messaging.

<section anchor='security-considerations'><name>Security Considerations</name>
 <t>
	The LLN nodes depend on the 6LBR and the RPL participants for their
    operation.
	A trust model must be put in place to ensure that the right devices are
	acting in these roles, so as to avoid threats such as black-holing,
        (see <xref target='RFC7416'/> section 7)
	or bombing attack whereby an impersonated 6LBR would destroy state in
	the network by using the "Removed" Status code.

 </t><t>
    This trust model could be
    at a minimum based on a Layer-2 Secure joining and the Link-Layer security.
    This is a generic 6LoWPAN requirement, see Req5.1 in Appendix of <xref target='RFC8505'/>.
 </t><t>
    Additionally, the trust model could include a role validation
    to ensure that the node that claims to be a 6LBR or a RPL Root is entitled
    to do so.
 </t><t>
    The anonymous EDAR message does not carry a valid Registration Unique ID
    <xref target='RFC8505'/> in the form of a ROVR and may be played by any node
    on the network without the need to know the ROVR.
    The 6LBR MUST NOT create an entry based on a
    anonymous EDAR that does not match an existing entry. All it can do is
    refresh the lifetime and the TID of an existing entry. So the
    message cannot be used to create a binding state in the 6LBR but it can be
 use to maintain one active longer than expected.
 </t><t>
 Note that a full EDAR message
 with a lifetime of 0 will destroy that state and the anonymous message will not recreate it. Note also that a rogue that has access to the network can attack the 6LBR with other (forged) addresses and ROVR, and that this is a much easier DoS
 attack than trying to keep existing state alive longer.
 </t><t>
    At the time of this writing RPL does not have a zerotrust model whereby
    the it is possible to validate the origin of an address that is injected
    in a DAO. This specification makes a first step in that direction by
    allowing the Root to challenge the RUL by the 6LR that serves it.

<section anchor='u8138'><name>Example Compression</name>

 <t>

 <xref target='rtghc'/> illustrates the case in Storing Mode where the packet
    is received from the Internet, then the Root encapsulates the packet to
    insert the RPI and deliver to the 6LR that is the parent and last hop to the
    final destination, which is not known to support <xref target='RFC8138'/>.

        ]]></artwork></figure>

    <t>
    The difference with the example format presented in Figure 19 of
    <xref target='RFC8138'/> is the addition of a SRH-6LoRH before the RPI-6LoRH
    to transport the compressed address of the 6LR as the destination address of
    the outer IPv6 header. In the original example the destination IP of the
    outer header was elided and was implicitly the same address as the
    destination of the inner header.

    Type 1 was arbitrarily chosen for this example, and
    the size of 0 denotes a single address in the SRH.
    </t>
    <t>
     In <xref target='rtghc'/>, the source of the IP-in-IP encapsulation is
          the Root, so it is elided in the IP-in-IP 6LoRH. The destination is
          the parent 6LR of the destination of the inner packet so it cannot be
          elided. In Storing Mode, it is placed as the single entry in an
          SRH-6LoRH as the first 6LoRH. Since there is a single entry so the
          SRH-6LoRH Size is 0. In this particular example, the 6LR address can
          be compressed to 2 bytes so a Type of 1 is used.
          It results that the total length of the SRH-6LoRH is 4 bytes.

       </t>
    <t>
          In Non-Storing Mode, the encapsulation from the Root would be similar
          to that represented in <xref target='rtghc'/> with possibly more hops
          in the SRH-6LoRH and possibly multiple SRH-6LoRHs if the various
          addresses in the routing header are not compressed to the same format.
          Note that on the last hop to the parent 6LR, the RH3 is consumed and
          removed from the compressed form, so the use of Non-Storing Mode vs.
          Storing Mode is indistinguishable from the packet format.
       </t>
    <t>
          Follows the RPI-6LoRH and then the IP-in-IP 6LoRH. When the
          IP-in-IP 6LoRH is removed, all the Router headers that precede it are
          also removed.
       </t>
    <t>
          The Paging Dispatch <xref target='RFC8025'/> may also be removed if
          there was no previous Page change to a Page other than 0 or 1, since
          the LOWPAN_IPHC is encoded in the same fashion in the default Page 0
          and in Page 1. The resulting packet to the destination is the inner
          packet compressed with <xref target='RFC6282'/>.
