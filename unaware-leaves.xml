<abstract>
<t>
  This specification extends RFC6550 and RFC8505 to provide routing services
  to Hosts called RPL Unaware Leaves that implement 6LoWPAN ND but do not
  participate to RPL.  This specification also enables the RPL Root to
  proxy the 6LoWPAN keep-alive flows in its DODAG.

<section anchor='introduction'><name>Introduction</name>

<t>The design of Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) is generally focused on
   saving energy, which is the most constrained resource of all. Other design
   constraints, such as a limited memory capacity, duty cycling of the LLN
   devices and low-power lossy transmissions, derive from that primary concern.
</t>


<t>The IETF produced the <xref target='RFC6550'>"Routing Protocol for Low Power
   and Lossy Networks"</xref> (RPL) to provide IPv6 <xref target='RFC8200'/>
   routing services within such constraints. RPL belongs to the class of
   Distance-Vector protocols, which, compared to link-state protocols,
   limit the amount of topological knowledge that needs to be installed and
   maintained in each node, and does not require convergence to avoid
   micro-loops.
</t>
<t> To save signaling and routing state in constrained networks,
   RPL allows a routing stretch (see <xref target='RFC6687'/>), whereby routing
   is only performed along an acyclic graph optimized to reach a Root node,
   as opposed to straight along a shortest path
   between 2 peers, whatever that would mean in a given LLN.
   This trades the quality of peer-to-peer (P2P) paths for a vastly reduced
   amount of control traffic and routing state that would be required to
   operate a any-to-any shortest path protocol.
   Finally, broken routes may be fixed lazily and on-demand, based on dataplane
   inconsistency discovery, which avoids wasting energy in the proactive repair
   of unused paths.

</t><t>
   To provide alternate paths in lossy networks, RPL forms Destination-Oriented
   Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs) using DODAG Information solicitation (DIS)
   and DODAG Information Object (DIO) messages. For many of the nodes, though
   not all, a DODAG provides multiple forwarding solutions towards the Root of
   the topology via so-called parents.
   RPL is designed to adapt to fuzzy connectivity, whereby the physical topology
   cannot be expected to reach a stable state, with a lazy control that creates
   the routes proactively, but may only fix them reactively, upon actual traffic.
   The result is that RPL provides reachability for most of the LLN nodes, most
   of the time, but may not converge in the classical sense.
</t>
<t>
   <xref target='RFC6550'/> provides unicast and multicast routing services
   to RPL-Aware nodes (RANs), either as a collection tree for outwards traffic only,
   or with routing back to the devices as well. In the latter case, a RAN injects routes to itself using Destination
   Advertisement Object (DAO) messages sent either to parent-nodes, in the RPL
   Storing Mode, or to the Root indicating their parent, in the Non-Storing Mode.

   This process effectively forms a DODAG back to the device that is a subset of
   the DODAG to the Root with all links reversed.
</t>
<t>
   RPL can be deployed as an extension to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)
   <xref target='RFC4861'/><xref target='RFC4862'/> and 6LoWPAN ND
   <xref target='RFC6775'/><xref target='RFC8505'/> to maintain reachability
   within a Non-Broadcast Multi-Access (NBMA) subnet.
   In that mode, some nodes may act as Routers and
   participate to the forwarding operations whereas others will only terminate
   packets, acting as Hosts in the data-plane.
   In <xref target='RFC6550'/> terms, a Host that is reachable over the RPL
   network is called a Leaf.
</t>
<t>
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'>
   "When to use RFC 6553, 6554 and IPv6-in-IPv6"</xref> introduces the term
   RPL-Aware-Leaf (RAL) for a Leaf that injects routes in RPL to manage the
   reachability of its own IPv6 addresses.
   In contrast, the term RPL-Unaware Leaf (RUL) designates a Leaf that does not
   participate to RPL at all. A RUL is an IPv6 Host <xref target="RFC8504" />
   that needs a RPL-Aware Router to obtain routing services over the RPL network.

</t>
<t>
   This specification leverages the Address Registration mechanism defined in
   6LoWPAN ND to enable a RUL as a 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) to interface with a
   RPL-Aware Router as a 6LoWPAN Router (6LR) and request that the 6LR injects
   a Host route for the Registered Address in the RPL routing on its behalf.
   A RUL may be unable to participate because it is very energy-constrained,
   or because it is unsafe to let it inject routes in RPL, in which case using
   6LowPAN ND as the interface for the RUL limits the surface of the possible
   attacks and optionally protects the address ownership.
</t>
<t>
   The RPL Non-Storing Mode mechanism is used to extend the routing state with
   connectivity to the RULs even when the DODAG is operated in Storing Mode.
   The unicast packet forwarding operation by the 6LR serving a 6LN that is also
   a RUL is described in <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/>.
</t>
<t>
   Examples of routing-agnostic 6LNs include lightly powered sensors such as
   window smash sensor (alarm system), and kinetically powered light switches.
   Other applications of this specification may include a smart grid network that
   controls appliances - such as washing machines or the heating system - in the
   home. Appliances may not participate to the RPL protocol operated in the
   Smartgrid network but can still interact with the Smartgrid for control and/or
   metering.

<section anchor='R6775'><name>RFC 6775 Address Registration</name>

<t>
   The classical "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) Protocol"
   <xref target='RFC4861'/> <xref target='RFC4862'/> was defined for serial
   links and transit media such as Ethernet. It is a reactive protocol that
   relies heavily on multicast operations for address discovery (aka lookup) and
   duplicate address detection (DAD).
</t><t>
   <xref target='RFC6775'>
   "Neighbor Discovery Optimizations for 6LoWPAN networks"</xref>
   adapts IPv6 ND for operations over energy-constrained LLNs.
   The main functions of <xref target='RFC6775'/> are to proactively establish
   the Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) in the 6LR and to prevent address duplication.
   To that effect, <xref target='RFC6775'/> introduces a new unicast Address
   Registration  mechanism that contributes to reducing the use of multicast
   messages compared to the classical IPv6 ND protocol.

</t><t><xref target='RFC6775'/> defines a new Address
   Registration Option (ARO) that is carried in the unicast
   Neighbor solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages between
   the 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) and the 6LoWPAN Router (6LR).

   It also defines the Duplicate Address Request (DAR) and Duplicate
   Address Confirmation (DAC) messages between the 6LR and the 6LoWPAN Border
   Router (6LBR).
   In an LLN, the 6LBR is the central repository of all the Registered Addresses
   in its domain and the source of truth for uniqueness and ownership.

<section anchor='R8505ER'><name>R Flag</name>
<t>
<xref target='RFC8505'/> introduces the "R" flag in the EARO.
   The Registering Node sets the "R" flag to indicate whether the 6LR should
   ensure reachability for the Registered Address.
   If the "R" flag is not set, then the Registering Node handles the reachability
   of the Registered Address by other means. In a RPL network, this means that
   either it is a RAN that injects the route by itself or that it uses another
   RPL Router for reachability services.
</t><t>
   This document specifies how the "R" flag is used in the context of RPL. A 6LN
   is a RUL that requires reachability services for an IPv6 address if and only
   if it sets the "R" flag in the NS(EARO) used to register the address to a RPL
   border router acting as 6LR. Upon receiving the NS(EARO), the RPL router
   generates a DAO message for the Registered Address if and only if the "R"
   flag is set.
</t>

</section> <!-- end section "R Flag" -->
<section anchor='R8505ETID'><name>TID, I Field and Opaque Fields</name>

<t>
   When the "T" flag is set, the EARO includes a sequence counter called
   Transaction ID (TID),
   which maps to the Path Sequence Field found in the RPL Transit Option.
   This is the reason why the support of <xref target='RFC8505'/>
   by the RUL as opposed to only <xref target='RFC6775'/> is a prerequisite for
   this specification (more in <xref target='prereq6lp'/>). The EARO also
   transports an Opaque field and an associated "I" field that describes what
   the Opaque field transports and how to use it.
   <xref target='ln'/> specifies the use of the "I" field and of the Opaque
   field by a RUL.
</t>

</section> <!-- end section "TID, I Field and Opaque Fields" -->
<section anchor='R8505EROVR'><name>ROVR</name>
<t>
   Section 5.3 of <xref target='RFC8505'/> introduces the Registration
   Ownership Verifier (ROVR) field of variable length from 64 to 256 bits.
   <!-- A ROVR is created by the Registering Node and associated to the Address Registration
   of an IPv6 Address. -->
   The ROVR is a replacement of the EUI-64 in the ARO
   <xref target='RFC6775'/> that was used to identify uniquely an Address
   Registration with the Link-Layer address of the owner but provided no
   protection against spoofing.
</t><t>

   <xref target='I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd'>"Address Protected Neighbor Discovery for
   Low-power and Lossy Networks"</xref> leverages the ROVR field as a
   cryptographic proof of ownership to prevent a rogue third party from misusing
   the address.
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd'/> adds a challenge/response exchange to the
   <xref target='RFC8505'/> Address Registration and enables Source Address Validation
   by a 6LR that will drop packets with a spoofed address.
</t><t>

   This specification does not address how the protection by
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd'/> could be extended to RPL. On the other
   hand, it adds the ROVR to the DAO to build the proxied EDAR at the Root
   (see <xref target='tgt'/>),
   which means that nodes that are aware of the Host route to the 6LN are made
   aware of the associated ROVR as well.
</t>

</section> <!-- end section "ROVR" -->

</section> <!-- end section "RFC 8505 Extended ARO" -->
<section anchor='R8505D'><name>RFC 8505 Extended DAR/DAC</name>
<t>
   <xref target='RFC8505'/> updates the DAR/DAC messages into the Extended
   DAR/DAC to carry the ROVR field.
   The EDAR/EDAC exchange takes place
   between the 6LR and the 6LBR. It is triggered by an NS(EARO) message from a 6LN to create, refresh and delete the corresponding state in the 6LBR.
   The exchange is protected by the ARQ mechanism specified in 8.2.6 of
   <xref target='RFC6775'/>, though in an LLN, a duration longer than the
   RETRANS_TIMER <xref target='RFC4861'/> of 1 second may be necessary to cover
   the Turn Around Trip delay between the 6LR and the 6LBR.

</t><t>
   RPL <xref target='RFC6550'/> specifies a periodic DAO from the 6LN all the way to
   the Root that maintains the routing state in the RPL network for the lifetime
   indicated by the source of the DAO.
   This means that for each address, there are two keep-alive messages
   that traverse the whole network, one to the Root and one to the 6LBR.
</t><t>

   This specification avoids the periodic EDAR/EDAC exchange across the LLN.
   The 6LR turns
   the periodic NS(EARO) from the RUL into a DAO message to the
   Root on every refresh, but it only generates the EDAR upon the first
   registration, for the purpose of DAD, which must be verified before the
   address is injected in RPL.
   Upon the DAO message, the Root proxies the EDAR exchange to refresh the state at the 6LBR on behalf of the 6LR, as illustrated in <xref target='fReg2'/>.
</t>

<section anchor='upd'><name>Updating RFC 6550</name>
<t>
   This document specifies a new behavior whereby a 6LR injects DAO messages
   for unicast addresses (see <xref target='op'/>) and multicast addresses
   (see <xref target='multiop'/>) on behalf of leaves that are not aware of RPL.
   The RUL addresses are exposed as external targets <xref target='RFC6550'/>.
   Conforming
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/>, an IP-in-IP encapsulation between the 6LR and the RPL Root is used to carry the RPL artifacts and remove them when forwarding outside the RPL domain, e.g., to a RUL.

</t><t>
   This document also synchronizes the liveness monitoring at the Root and the
   6LBR. The same value of lifetime is used for both, and a single keep-alive
   message, the RPL DAO, traverses the RPL network. A new behavior is introduced
   whereby the RPL Root proxies the EDAR message to the 6LBR on behalf of the
   6LR (more in <xref target='upd2'/>), for any 6LN, RUL or RAN.

</t><t>
   Section 6.7.7 of <xref target='RFC6550'/> introduces RPL Target Option, which
   can be used in RPL Control messages such as the DAO message to signal a
   destination prefix.
   <xref target='tgt'/> adds the capabilities to
   transport the ROVR field (see <xref target='R8505EROVR'/>) and the IPv6
   Address of the prefix advertiser when the Target is a shorter prefix,
   signaled by a new "F" flag.
   The position of the "F" flag is indicated in <xref target='iana-full'/>.
</t><t>
   Section 6.7.6 of <xref target='RFC6550'/> defines the DODAG Configuration
   option with reserved flags. This specification defines the new "Root Proxies
   EDAR/EDAC" (P) flag and encodes it in one of these reserved flags.
   The "P" flag is set to indicate that the Root performs the proxy operation,
   which implies that it supports the Updated RPL Target Option
   (see <xref target='tgt'/>).
   The position of the "P" flag is indicated in <xref target='iana-conf'/>.

</t><t>
   Section 6.3.1 of <xref target='RFC6550'/> defines a 3-bit Mode of Operation
   (MOP) in the
   DIO Base Object. The new "P" flag is defined only for MOP value between 0 to
   6. For a MOP value of 7 or above, the flag MAY be redefined
   and MUST NOT be interpreted as "Root Proxies EDAR/EDAC" unless the
   specification of the MOP indicates to do so.

</t><t>
   The RPL Status defined in section 6.5.1 of <xref target="RFC6550"/>
   for use in the DAO-ACK message is extended to be placed in DCO messages
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-efficient-npdao'/> as well. Furthermore, this

<t>

   This document updates <xref target='RFC8505'/> to change the behavior of a
   RPL Router acting as 6LR in the 6LoWPAN ND Address Registration of a RUL
   acting as 6LN.
   If the RPL Root advertise the capability to proxy the EDAR/EDAC
   exchange to the 6LBR, the 6LR refrains from sending the keep-alive EDAR
   message. Instead, if it is separated from the 6LBR, the Root regenerates the
   EDAR message to the 6LBR periodically, upon a DAO message that signals the liveliness of the Address.

<section anchor='prereq'><name>Requirements on the RPL-Unware Leaf</name>
<t>
   This document provides RPL routing for a RUL, that is a 6LN acting as an IPv6
   Host and not aware of RPL. Still, a minimal RPL-independent functionality is
   required from the RUL to obtain routing services.
</t>
 <section anchor='prereq6lp'><name>Support of 6LoWPAN ND</name>
<t>
   In order to obtain routing services from a 6LR, a RUL MUST implement
   <xref target='RFC8505'/> and set the "R" and "T" flags in the EARO.
   The RUL SHOULD support <xref target='I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd'/> to
   protect the ownership of its addresses.
   The RUL MUST NOT request routing services from a 6LR that does not originate
   RA messages with a CIO that has the L, P, and E flags all set as discussed in
   <xref target='R7400'/>, unless configured to do so.
</t>
<t>
   A RUL that may attach to multiple 6LRs MUST prefer those that provide routing
   services.
   The RUL MUST register to all the 6LRs from which it desires routing services.
</t><t>
   Parallel Address Registrations to several 6LRs SHOULD be performed in an rapid sequence, using the exact same EARO for the same Address. Gaps between
   the Address Registrations will invalidate some of the routes till the Address
   Registration finally shows on those routes.
</t>

<t><xref target='RFC8505'/> introduces error Status values in the NA(EARO)
   which can be received synchronously upon an NS(EARO) or asynchronously. The
   RUL MUST support both cases and MUST refrain from using the address
   when the Status Value indicates a rejection.

</t>

</section> <!-- end section "Support of 6LoWPAN ND" -->
<section anchor='prereqv6'><name>External Routes and RPL Artifacts</name>

<t>
   Section 4.1 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/> provides a set of
   rules detailed below that MUST be followed for routing packets from and to a RUL.
</t><t>
   A 6LR that acts as a border router for external routes advertises them using
   Non-Storing Mode DAO messages that are unicast directly to the Root, even if
   the DODAG is operated in Storing Mode.
   Non-Storing Mode routes are not visible inside the RPL domain and all packets
   are routed via the Root. The RPL Root tunnels the packets directly to the
   6LR that advertised the external route, which decapsulates and forwards the
   original (inner) packet.
</t><t>
   The RPL Non-Storing MOP signaling and the associated IP-in-IP encapsulated
   packets appear as normal traffic to the intermediate Routers. The support
   of external routes only impacts the Root and the 6LR. It can be operated with
   legacy intermediate routers and does not add to the amount of state that must
   be maintained in those routers.
   A RUL is an example of a destination that is reachable via an external route
   that happens to be also a Host route.
</t><t>
   The RPL data packets always carry a Hop-by-Hop Header to transport a RPL
   Packet Information (RPI) <xref target='RFC6550'/>.
   So unless the RUL originates its packets with an RPI, the 6LR needs to tunnel
   them to the Root to add the RPI. As a rule of a thumb and except for the very
   special case above, the packets from and to a RUL are always encapsulated
   using an IP-in-IP tunnel between the Root and the 6LR that serves the RUL
   (see sections 7.1.4, 7.2.3, 7.2.4, 7.3.3, 7.3.4, 8.1.3, 8.1.4, 8.2.3,
   8.2.4, 8.3.3 and 8.3.4 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/> for details).
</t><t>
   In Non-Storing Mode, packets going down carry a Source Routing Header (SRH).
   The IP-in-IP encapsulation, the RPI and the SRH are collectively called the
   "RPL artifacts" and can be compressed using <xref target='RFC8138'/>.
   <xref target='rtghc'/> presents an example compressed format for a packet
   forwarded by the Root to a RUL in a Storing Mode DODAG.
</t><t>
   The inner packet that is forwarded to the RUL may carry some RPL artifacts,
   e.g., an RPI if the original packet was generated with it, and an SRH in a
   Non-Storing Mode DODAG.
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/> expects the RUL to support the
   basic <xref target='RFC8504'>"IPv6 Node Requirements"</xref>.
   In particular the RUL is expected to ignore the RPL artifacts that are
   either consumed or not applicable to a Host.
   <!--
   Such a host may not necessarily ignore IP-in-IP encapsulation, which is
   dealt with below.
   -->

</t><t>
   A RUL is not expected to support the compression method defined in
   <xref target='RFC8138'/>. Unless configured otherwise, the border
   router MUST restore the outgoing packet before forwarding over an external
   route, even if it is not the destination of the incoming packet, and even
   when delivering to a RUL.

</t>
<section anchor='prereqv6ip'><name>Support of IPv6 Encapsulation</name>

<t>
   Section 2.1 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/> defines the rules
   for tunneling either to the final destination (6LN) or to its
   attachment router (6LR). To terminate the IP-in-IP tunnel, the 6LN,
   as an IPv6 Host, must be able to decapsulate the tunneled packet and either
   drop the inner packet if it is not the final destination, or pass it to the
   upper layer for further processing.
   Unless it is aware by other means that the RUL can handle IP-in-IP properly,
   which is not mandated by <xref target='RFC8504'/>, the Root terminates the
   IP-in-IP tunnel at the parent 6LR. It is thus not necessary for a RUL to
   support IP-in-IP decapsulation.
</t>

</section> <!-- end section "Support of IPv6 Encapsulation" -->

   A RUL is expected to process an Option Type in a Hop-by-Hop Header as

<section anchor='tgt'><name>Updated RPL Target Option</name>
<t> This specification updates the RPL Target Option to transport the ROVR

<t>
  The description below assumes that the Root sets the "P" flag in the
  DODAG Configuration Option and performs the EDAR proxy operation.
</t><t>
  If the
  "P" flag is reset, the 6LR MUST generate the periodic  EDAR messages and
  process the returned status as specified in <xref target='RFC8505'/>.
  If the EDAC indicates success, the rest of the flow takes place as presented
  but without the proxied EDAR/EDAC exchange.
</t>

<section anchor='flow'><name>General Flow</name>

  <t>
   This specification eliminates the need to exchange keep-alive Extended
   Duplicate Address messages, EDAR and EDAC, all the way from a 6LN to the 6LBR
   across a RPL mesh. Instead, the EDAR/EDAC exchange with the 6LBR is proxied
   by the RPL Root upon the DAO message that refreshes the RPL routing state.
   The first EDAR upon a new Registration cannot be proxied, though, as it
   serves for the purpose of DAD, which must be verified before the address is
   injected in RPL.

 </t><t>
   In a RPL
   network where the function is enabled, refreshing the state in the 6LBR is
   the responsibility of the Root. Consequently, only addresses that are
   injected in RPL will be kept alive at the 6LBR by the RPL Root.
   <!--
   In a same fashion, if an additional routing
   protocol is deployed on a same network, that additional routing protocol may
   need to handle the keep alive procedure for the addresses that it serves.
-->
 </t><t>
    Since RULs are advertised using Non-Storing Mode, the DAO message flow
    and the keep alive EDAR/EDAC can be nested within the Address
    (re)Registration flow.
    <xref target='fReg1'/> illustrates that for the first Registration,
    both the DAD and the keep-alive EDAR/EDAC exchanges happen in the same
    sequence.

   To achieve this, the lifetimes and

    This is what causes the RPL Root to refresh the state in the 6LBR, using an
    EDAC message.
    In case of an error in the proxied EDAR flow, the error is
    returned in the DAO-ACK using a RPL Status with the 'A' flag set that imbeds
    a 6LoWPAN Status Value as discussed in <xref target='stat'/>.

 </t> <t>

    The 6LR may receive a requested DAO-ACK after it received an asynchronous
    DCO, but the negative Status in the DCO supersedes a positive
    Status in the DAO-ACK regardless of the order in which they are received.
    Upon the DAO-ACK - or the DCO if one arrives first - the 6LR responds to the
    RUL with an NA(EARO).

 </t> <t>
    The RUL MAY terminate the registration at any time by using a Registration
    Lifetime of 0.
    This specification requires that the RPL Target Option transports the ROVR.
    This way, the same flow as the heartbeat flow is sufficient to inform the
    6LBR using the Root as proxy as illustrated in <xref target="fReg2"/>.

 </t> <t>
    Any combination of the logical functions of 6LR, Root and 6LBR might be
   collapsed in a single node.
</t>

</section>
<section anchor='oper'><name>Detailed Operation</name>


<section anchor='ln'><name>Perspective of the RUL Acting as 6LN</name>
<t>
  This specification does not alter the operation of a 6LoWPAN ND-compliant 6LN,
  and a RUL is expected to operate as follows:
</t>
<ol spacing='normal'><li>
   The 6LN obtains an IPv6 global address, either using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) <xref target='RFC4862'/> based on a Prefix
   Information Option (PIO) <xref target='RFC4861'/> found in an RA message, or
   some other means such as DHCPv6 <xref target='RFC3315'/>.

</li><li>
   Once it has formed an address, the 6LN (re)registers its address periodically,
   within the Lifetime of the previous Address Registration, as prescribed by
   <xref target='RFC6775'/>, to refresh the NCE
   before the lifetime indicated in the EARO expires. It MUST set the "T" flag
   and the TID is incremented each time and wraps in a lollipop fashion (see
   section 5.2.1 of <xref target='RFC8505'/> which is fully compatible with
   section 7.2 of <xref target='RFC6550'/>).
</li><li>
   As stated in section 5.2 of <xref target='RFC8505'/>, the 6LN can register
   to more than one 6LR at the same time. In that case, it
   uses the same EARO for all of the parallel Address Registrations. The 6LN SHOULD send the registration(s) that have a non-zero Registration Lifetime
   and ensure that one succeeds before it terminates other registrations, to
   maintain the state in the network and at the 6LBR and minimize the churn.

</li><li>
   Following section 5.1 of <xref target='RFC8505'/>,
   a 6LN acting as a RUL sets the "R" flag in the EARO of at least one
   registration, whereas acting as a RAN it never does. If the "R" flag is not
   echoed in the NA, the RUL SHOULD attempt to use another 6LR. The RUL SHOULD send the registration(s) with the "R" flag set and ensure that one succeeds
   before it sends the registrations with the flag reset. In case of a conflict
   with the preceeding rule on lifetime, the rule on lifetime has precedence.

</li><li>
   The 6LN may use any of the 6LRs to which it registered as default gateway.
   Using a 6LR to which the 6LN is not registered may result in packets dropped
   at the 6LR by a Source Address Validation function (SAVI) so it is
   NOT RECOMMENDED.
</li>

</ol>

<t>
   Even without support for RPL, a RUL may be aware of opaque values to be
   provided to the routing protocol. If the RUL has a knowledge of the RPL
   Instance the packet should be injected into, then it SHOULD set the Opaque
   field in the EARO to the RPLInstanceID, else it MUST leave the Opaque field
   to zero.
</t>
<t>
   Regardless of the setting of the Opaque field, the 6LN MUST set the "I"
   field to zero to signal "topological information to be passed to a routing
   process" as specified in section 5.1 of <xref target='RFC8505'/>.
</t><t>
   A RUL is not expected to produce RPL artifacts in the data packets, but it
   MAY do so. For instance, if the RUL has a minimal awareness of the RPL
   Instance then it can build an RPI. A RUL that places an RPI in a data packet
   MUST indicate the RPLInstanceID of the RPL Instance where the
   packet should be forwarded. All the flags and the Rank field are set
   to zero as specified by section 11.2 of <xref target='RFC6550'/>.
</t>
</section>




<section anchor='lr'><name>Perspective of the Border Router Acting as 6LR</name>
<t>
   Also as prescribed by <xref target='RFC8505'/>,
   the 6LR generates an EDAR message upon reception of a valid NS(EARO)
   message for the registration of a new IPv6 Address by a 6LN.
   If the initial EDAR/EDAC exchange succeeds, then the 6LR installs an NCE
   for the Registration Lifetime. For the registration refreshes, if the RPL Root has indicated that it proxies the keep-alive EDAR/EDAC exchange with the 6LBR (see <xref target='upd'/>), the 6LR MUST refrain from sending the keep-alive EDAR.
</t>

<t>
   If the "R" flag is set in the NS(EARO), the 6LR MUST inject the
   Host route in RPL, unless this is barred for other reasons, such as the saturation of the RPL parents. The 6LR MUST use a RPL Non-Storing Mode
   signaling and the updated Target Option (see <xref target='tgt'/>). The 6LR MUST request a DAO-ACK by setting the 'K' flag in the DAO
   message. Success injecting the route to the RUL is indicated by the 'E' flag
   set to 0 in the RPL status of the DAO-ACK message.
</t>


 <t>
   The Opaque field in the EARO hints the 6LR on the RPL Instance that SHOULD
   be used for the DAO advertisements, and for the forwarding of packets sourced
   at the registered address when there is no RPI in the packet, in which case
   the 6LR MUST encapsulate the packet to the Root adding an RPI in the
   outer header.
   If the Opaque field is zero, the 6LR is free to use the default RPL Instance
   (zero) for the registered address or to select an Instance of its choice.
</t> <t>
   If the "I" field is not zero, then the 6LR MUST consider that the Opaque
   field is zero. If the Opaque field is not zero, then it is expected to
   carry a RPLInstanceID for the RPL Instance suggested by the 6LN.
   If the 6LR does not participate to the associated Instance, then the 6LR MUST
   consider that the Opaque field is zero;
   else, that is if the 6LR participates to the suggested RPL Instance, then the
   6LR SHOULD use that Instance for the Registered Address.
</t>
<t>
  The DAO message advertising the Registered Address MUST be constructed as
  follows:
  </t>
<ol spacing='normal'>
  <li>The Registered Address is signaled as Target Prefix in the updated Target Option in the DAO message; the Prefix Length is set to 128. The ROVR field is copied unchanged from the EARO (see <xref target='tgt'/>).
  </li><li>
  The 6LR indicates one of its global or unique-local IPv6 unicast addresses as the Parent Address in the RPL Transit Information Option (TIO) associated with the Target Option
  </li><li>
  The 6LR sets the External 'E' flag in the TIO to indicate that it redistributes
  an external target into the RPL network

  </li><li>
  the Path Lifetime in the TIO is computed from the Lifetime in the EARO
  Option. This adapts it to the Lifetime Units used in the RPL operation;
  note that if the lifetime is 0, then the DAO message is a No-Path DAO
  that cleans up the the routes down to the RUL; this also causes the Root as a proxy to send an EDAR message to the 6LBR with a Lifetime of 0.
  </li><li>
  the Path Sequence in the TIO is set to the TID value found in the EARO option.
  </li>

</ol>

<t>

   Upon receiving the DAO-ACK or an asynchronous DCO message, the 6LR
   MUST send the NA(EARO) to the RUL.

</t><t>
   The 6LR MUST set "R" flag in the NA(EARO) back if and only if the 'E' flag is
   reset, indicating that the 6LR injected the Registered Address in the RPL
   routing successfully and that the EDAR proxy operation succeeded.
</t><t>

   If the 'A' flag in the RPL Status is set, the embedded Status Value is passed
   back to the RUL in the EARO Status.
   If the 'E' flags is also set, the registration failed for
   6LoWPAN ND related reasons, and the NCE is removed.
</t><t>

   If the 'A' flag is not set in the RPL Status of the DAO-ACK, then the 6LoWPAN
   ND operation succeeded and an EARO Status of 0 (Success) MUST be returned to
   the RUL, even if the 'E' flag is set in the RPL Status. The EARO Status of 0
   MUST also be used if the 6LR could not even try to inject the route.

</t><t>
   This means that, in case of an error injecting the route that is not related
   to ND, the registration succeeds but the RPL route is not installed, which is
   signaled by the "R" flag reset. It is up to the 6LN to keep the binding with the 6LR or destroy it.
</t><t>
   In a network where Address Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND) is enabled,
   in case of a DAO-ACK or a DCO indicating transporting an EARO
   Status Value of 5 (Validation Requested), the 6LR MUST
   challenge the 6LN for ownership of the address, as described in section
   6.1 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd'/>, before the Registration is
   complete. This ensures that the address is validated before it is injected in
   the RPL routing.
</t>
<t>
   If the challenge succeeds then the operations continue as normal.
   In particular a DAO message is generated
   upon the NS(EARO) that proves the ownership of the address. If the challenge
   failed, the 6LR rejects the registration as prescribed by AP-ND and may take
   actions to protect itself against DoS attacks by a rogue 6LN, see
   <xref target='security-considerations'/>.

</t><t>
   The 6LR may at any time send a unicast asynchronous NA(EARO) with the "R" flag reset to signal that it stops providing routing services, and/or with the EARO Status 2 "Neighbor Cache full" to signal that it removes the NCE. It may also send a final RA, unicast or multicast, with a Router Lifetime field of zero, to signal that it stops serving as router, as specified in section 6.2.5 of <xref target='RFC4861'/>.
</t><t>

   If a 6LR receives a valid NS(EARO) message with the "R" flag reset and a
   Registration Lifetime that is not 0, and the 6LR
   was injecting the Registered Address due to previous NS(EARO) messages
   with the "R" flag set, then the 6LR MUST stop injecting the address.
   It is up to the Registering 6LN to maintain the corresponding route from then
   on, either keeping it active via a different 6LR or by acting as a RAN and
   managing its own reachability.

</t>


</section>

<section anchor='Root'><name>Perspective of the RPL Root</name>

<t>
   A RPL Root SHOULD set the "P" flag in the RPL DODAG Configuration Option of the DIO
   messages that it generates (see <xref target='upd'/>) to signal that it
   proxies the EDAR/EDAC exchange and supports the Updated RPL Target
   option. The remainder of this section assumes that it does.

</t><t>
   Upon reception of a DAO message, for each updated RPL Target Option
   (see <xref target='tgt'/>) that
   creates or updates an existing RPL state, the Root MUST notify the 6LBR.
   This can be done using an internal API if they are integrated, or using a
   proxied EDAR/EDAC exchange if they are separate entities.

</t>


  <t>
  The EDAR message MUST be constructed as follows:
  </t>
<ol spacing='normal'>
  <li>
  The Target IPv6 address from the RPL Target Option is placed in the
  Registered Address field of the EDAR message;
  <!--and in the Target field of the NS message, respectively-->
  </li><li>
  the Registration Lifetime is adapted from the Path Lifetime in the TIO by
  converting the Lifetime Units used in RPL into units of 60 seconds used in the
  6LoWPAN ND messages;
  </li><li>
  <!--
  the RPL Root indicates its own MAC Address as Source Link Layer Address (SLLA)
  in the NS(EARO);
  </li><li>
  -->
  the TID value is set to the Path Sequence in the TIO and indicated with an ICMP
  code of 1 in the EDAR message;
  </li><li>
  The ROVR in the RPL Target Option is copied as is in the
  EDAR and the ICMP Code Suffix is set to the appropriate value as shown in
  Table 4 of <xref target='RFC8505'/> depending on the size of the ROVR field.
  </li>
</ol>

<t>
   Upon receiving an EDAC message from the 6LBR, if a DAO is pending, then the
   Root MUST send a DAO-ACK back to the 6LR. Else, if the Status in the EDAC message is not "Success", then it MUST send an asynchronous DCO to the 6LR.
</t>
<t>
   In either case, the EDAC Status is embedded in the RPL Status with the 'A'
   flag set.
</t>

</section>

<section anchor='lbr'><name>Perspective of the 6LBR</name>

<t>
  The 6LBR is unaware that the RPL Root is not the new attachment 6LR of the RUL,
  so it is not impacted by this specification.
</t>

<t>
   Upon reception of an EDAR message,
   the 6LBR acts as prescribed by <xref target='RFC8505'/> and returns an EDAC message to the sender.

<section anchor='multiop'><name>Protocol Operations for Multicast Addresses</name>

 <t> Section 12 of <xref target='RFC6550'/> details the RPL support for
    multicast flows. This support is not source-specific and only operates as
    an extension to the Storing Mode of Operation for unicast packets. Note that
    it is the RPL model that the multicast packet is passed as a Layer-2 unicast
    to each of the interested children.
    This remains true when forwarding between the 6LR and the listener 6LN.
 </t>
 <t>
 <xref target='RFC2710'>"Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6"</xref>
    and its updated version <xref target='RFC3810'>
    "Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6"</xref> provide an
    interface for a listener to register to multicast flows.
    MLDv2 is backwards compatible with MLD, and adds in particular the
    capability to filter the sources via black lists and white lists.
    In the MLD model, the Router is a "querier" and the Host is a multicast
    listener that registers to the querier to obtain copies of the particular
    flows it is interested in.


 </t><t>
     On the first Address Registration, as illustrated in <xref target='fReg3'/>, the
     6LN, as an MLD listener, sends an unsolicited Report to the 6LR in order to
     start receiving the flow immediately.

 <t> Since multicast Layer-2 messages are
     avoided, it is important that the asynchronous messages for unsolicited
     Report and Done are sent reliably, for instance using a Layer-2
     acknowledgment, or attempted multiple times.
 </t><t>
     The 6LR acts as a generic MLD querier and generates a DAO for the multicast
     target. The lifetime of the DAO is set to be in the order of the Query
     Interval, yet larger to account for variable propagation delays.

 </t><t>
     The Root proxies the MLD exchange as a listener with the 6LBR acting as the
     querier, so as to get packets from a source external to the RPL domain.

 </t><t>
     Upon a DAO with a multicast target, the RPL Root checks if it is
     already registered as a listener for that address, and if not, it performs
     its own unsolicited Report for the multicast target.
 </t>
 <t>
    An Address re-Registration is pulled periodically by 6LR acting as querier.
    Note that the message may be sent unicast to all the known individual
    listeners.

 </t>
 <t>
    Upon the timing out of the Query Interval, the 6LR sends a Query to each of
    its listeners, and gets a Report back that is mapped into a DAO, as

<section anchor='security-considerations'><name>Security Considerations</name>
 <t>
   First of all, it is worth noting that with <xref target='RFC6550'/>, every
   node in the LLN is RPL-aware and can inject any RPL-based attack in the
   network. This specification isolates edge nodes that can only interact with
   the RPL routers using 6LoWPAN ND, meaning that they cannot perform RPL
   insider attacks.
 </t>
 <t>
   6LoWPAN ND can optionally provide SAVI features with <xref target='I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd'/>, which
   reduces even more the attack perimeter that is available to the edge nodes.
 </t>
 <t>
	The LLN nodes depend on the 6LBR and the RPL participants for their
    operation.
	A trust model must be put in place to ensure that the right devices are
	acting in these roles, so as to avoid threats such as black-holing,
        (see <xref target='RFC7416'/> section 7)
	or bombing attack whereby an impersonated 6LBR would destroy state in
	the network by using the "Removed" Status code.

 </t><t>
    This trust model could be
    at a minimum based on a Layer-2 Secure joining and the Link-Layer security.
    This is a generic 6LoWPAN requirement, see Req5.1 in Appendix of <xref target='RFC8505'/>.
 </t><t>
    Additionally, the trust model could include a role validation
    to ensure that the node that claims to be a 6LBR or a RPL Root is entitled
    to do so.
 </t><t>
    At the time of this writing RPL does not have a zerotrust model whereby
    it is possible to validate the origin of an address that is injected
    in a DAO. This specification makes a first step in that direction by
    allowing the Root to challenge the RUL via the 6LR that serves it.

<section anchor='u8138'><name>Example Compression</name>

 <t>

 <xref target='rtghc'/> illustrates the case in Storing Mode where the packet
    is received from the Internet, then the Root encapsulates the packet to
    insert the RPI and deliver to the 6LR that is the parent and last hop to the
    final destination, which is not known to support <xref target='RFC8138'/>.

    </t>

        ]]></artwork></figure>

    <t>
    The difference with the example presented in Figure 19 of
    <xref target='RFC8138'/> is the addition of a SRH-6LoRH before the RPI-6LoRH
    to transport the compressed address of the 6LR as the destination address of
    the outer IPv6 header. In the original example the destination IP of the
    outer header was elided and was implicitly the same address as the
    destination of the inner header.

    Type 1 was arbitrarily chosen, and the size of 0 denotes a single address in
    the SRH.
    </t>
    <t>
     In <xref target='rtghc'/>, the source of the IP-in-IP encapsulation is
          the Root, so it is elided in the IP-in-IP 6LoRH. The destination is
          the parent 6LR of the destination of the inner packet so it cannot be
          elided. If the DODAG is operated in Storing Mode, it is the single
          entry in the SRH-6LoRH and the SRH-6LoRH Size is encoded as 0.
          The SRH-6LoRH is the first 6LoRH in the chain.
          In this particular example, the 6LR address can
          be compressed to 2 bytes so a Type of 1 is used.
          It results that the total length of the SRH-6LoRH is 4 bytes.

       </t>
    <t>
          In Non-Storing Mode, the encapsulation from the Root would be similar
          to that represented in <xref target='rtghc'/> with possibly more hops
          in the SRH-6LoRH and possibly multiple SRH-6LoRHs if the various
          addresses in the routing header are not compressed to the same format.
          Note that on the last hop to the parent 6LR, the RH3 is consumed and
          removed from the compressed form, so the use of Non-Storing Mode vs.
          Storing Mode is indistinguishable from the packet format.
       </t>
    <t>
          The SRH-6LoRHs are followed by RPI-6LoRH and then the IP-in-IP 6LoRH.
          When the IP-in-IP 6LoRH is removed, all the 6LoRH Headers that
          precede it are also removed.
          The Paging Dispatch <xref target='RFC8025'/> may also be removed if
          there was no previous Page change to a Page other than 0 or 1, since
          the LOWPAN_IPHC is encoded in the same fashion in the default Page 0
          and in Page 1. The resulting packet to the destination is the inner
          packet compressed with <xref target='RFC6282'/>.
