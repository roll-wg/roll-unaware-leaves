<section anchor='introduction'><name>Introduction</name>

<t>The design of Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) is generally focused on
   saving energy, which is the most constrained resource of all. Other design
   constraints, such as a limited memory capacity, duty cycling of the LLN
   devices and low-power lossy transmissions, derive from that primary concern.
</t>


<t>The IETF produced the <xref target='RFC6550'>"Routing Protocol for Low Power
   and Lossy Networks"</xref> (RPL) to provide IPv6 <xref target='RFC8200'/>
   routing services within such constraints. RPL belongs to the class of
   Distance-Vector protocols, which, compared to link-state protocols,
   limit the amount of topological knowledge that needs to be installed and
   maintained in each node, and does not require convergence to avoid
   micro-loops.
</t>
<t>
   To save signaling and routing state in constrained networks,
   RPL allows a path stretch (see <xref target='RFC6687'/>), whereby routing
   is only performed along a Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) that is optimized to reach a Root node, as opposed to along the shortest path
   between 2 peers, whatever that would mean in a given LLN.
   This trades the quality of peer-to-peer (P2P) paths for a vastly reduced
   amount of control traffic and routing state that would be required to
   operate an any-to-any shortest path protocol. Additionally,
   broken routes may be fixed lazily and on-demand, based on dataplane
   inconsistency discovery, which avoids wasting energy in the proactive repair
   of unused paths.

</t>
<t>
   For many of the nodes, though not all, the DODAG provides multiple
   forwarding solutions towards the Root of the topology via so-called parents.
   RPL is designed to adapt to fuzzy connectivity, whereby the physical topology
   cannot be expected to reach a stable state, with a lazy control that creates
   the routes proactively, but may only fix them reactively, upon actual traffic.
   The result is that RPL provides reachability for most of the LLN nodes, most
   of the time, but may not converge in the classical sense.
</t>
<!--t>
   <xref target='RFC6550'/> provides unicast and multicast routing services
   to RPL-Aware nodes (RANs), either as a collection tree for outwards traffic only,
   or with routing back to the devices as well. In the latter case, a RAN injects routes to itself using Destination
   Advertisement Object (DAO) messages sent either to parent-nodes, in the RPL
   Storing Mode, or to the Root indicating their parent, in the Non-Storing Mode.

   This process effectively forms a DODAG back to the device that is a subset of
   the DODAG to the Root with all links reversed.
</t-->
<t>
   RPL can be deployed in conjunction with IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)
   <xref target='RFC4861'/> <xref target='RFC4862'/> and 6LoWPAN ND
   <xref target='RFC6775'/> <xref target='RFC8505'/> to maintain reachability
   within a Non-Broadcast Multiple-Access     (NBMA) Multi-Link subnet.
</t>
<t>
   In that mode, IPv6 addresses are advertised individually as Host routes.
   Some nodes may act as Routers and participate in the forwarding operations
   whereas others will only terminate packets, acting as Hosts in the data-plane.
   In <xref target='RFC6550'/> terms, an IPv6 Host <xref target='RFC8504'/>
   that is reachable over the RPL network is called a Leaf.
</t>
<t>
   Section 2 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/> defines the terms
   RPL Leaf, RPL-Aware-Leaf (RAL) and RPL-Unaware Leaf (RUL).
   A RPL Leaf is a Host attached to one or more RPL router(s); as such, it
   relies on the RPL router(s) to forward its traffic across the RPL domain but
   does not forward traffic from another node. As opposed to the RAL, the
   RUL does not participate to RPL, and relies on its RPL router(s) also to
   inject the routes to its IPv6 addresses in the RPL domain.
</t>
<t>
   A RUL may be unable to participate because it is very energy-constrained,
   code-space constrained, or because it would be unsafe to let it inject
   routes in RPL. Using 6LoWPAN ND as opposed to RPL as the Host-to-Router
   interface limits the surface of the possible attacks by the RUL against the
   RPL domain, and can protect RUL for its address ownership.
</t>
<t>
   This document specifies how the Router injects the Host routes in the RPL
   domain on behalf of the RUL. <xref target='prereq'/> details how the RUL
   can leverage 6LoWPAN ND to obtain the routing services from the router.
   In that model, the RUL is also a 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) and the RPL-Aware router
   is also a 6LoWPAN Router (6LR). Using the 6LoWPAN ND Address Registration
   mechanism, the RUL signals that the router must inject a Host route for the
   Registered Address.
</t>
<t>
   The RPL Non-Storing Mode mechanism is used to extend the routing state with
   connectivity to the RULs even when the DODAG is operated in Storing Mode.
   The unicast packet forwarding operation by the 6LR serving a RUL is described
   in section 4.1 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/>.
</t>
<t>
   Examples of possible RULs include severely energy constrained sensors such as
   window smash sensor (alarm system), and kinetically powered light switches.
   Other applications of this specification may include a smart grid network that
   controls appliances - such as washing machines or the heating system - in the
   home. Appliances may not participate to the RPL protocol operated in the
   Smartgrid network but can still interact with the Smartgrid for control and/or
   metering.

   This document is organized as follows:
</t>

<ul spacing='normal'>

<li>
    <xref target='prereqv6'/> and <xref target='lpnd'/> present in a
    non-normative fashion the salient aspects of RPL and 6LoWPAN ND,
    respectively, that are leveraged in this specification to provide
    connectivity to a 6LN acting as a RUL across a RPL network.
</li>

<li>
    <xref target='prereq'/> lists the expectations that a RUL needs to match
    in order to be served by a RPL router that complies with this specification.
</li>

<li>
    <xref target='upd'/> presents the changes made to <xref target='RFC6550'/>;
    a new behavior is introduced whereby the 6LR advertises the 6LN's addresses in a RPL DAO message based on the ND registration by the 6LN, and the RPL
    root performs the EDAR/EDAC exchange with the 6LBR on behalf of the 6LR;
    modifications are introduced to some RPL options and to the RPL Status to
    facilitate the integration of the protocols.
</li>

<li>
     <xref target='updnpdao'/> presents the changes made to
    <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-efficient-npdao'/>; the use of the DCO message is extended to the Non-Storing MOP to report asynchronous issues from the Root to the 6LR.
</li>

<li>
    <xref target='upd2'/> presents the changes made to <xref target='RFC6775'/>

<section anchor='prereqv6'><name>RPL External Routes and Dataplane Artifacts</name>

<t>
   Section 4.1 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/> provides a set of
   rules detailed below that must be followed for routing packets from and to a RUL.
</t><t>
   A 6LR that acts as a border Router for external routes advertises them using
   Non-Storing Mode DAO messages that are unicast directly to the Root, even if
   the DODAG is operated in Storing Mode.
   Non-Storing Mode routes are not visible inside the RPL domain and all packets
   are routed via the Root. The RPL Root tunnels the packets directly to the
   6LR that advertised the external route, which decapsulates and forwards the
   original (inner) packet.
</t><t>
   The RPL Non-Storing MOP signaling and the associated IP-in-IP encapsulated
   packets appear as normal traffic to the intermediate Routers. The support
   of external routes only impacts the Root and the 6LR. It can be operated with
   legacy intermediate Routers and does not add to the amount of state that must
   be maintained in those Routers.
   A RUL is an example of a destination that is reachable via an external route
   that happens to be also a Host route.
</t><t>
   The RPL data packets always carry a Hop-by-Hop Header to transport a RPL
   Packet Information (RPI) <xref target='RFC6550'/>.
   So unless the RUL originates its packets with an RPI, the 6LR needs to tunnel
   them to the Root to add the RPI. As a rule of a thumb and except for the very
   special case above, the packets from and to a RUL are always encapsulated
   using an IP-in-IP tunnel between the Root and the 6LR that serves the RUL
   (see sections 7 and 8 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/> for details).
   If the packet from the RUL has an RPI, the 6LR as a RPL border router
   SHOULD rewrite the RPI to indicate the selected Instance and set the flags,
   but it does not need to encapsulate the packet.
</t><t>
   In Non-Storing Mode, packets going down carry a Source Routing Header (SRH).
   The IP-in-IP encapsulation, the RPI and the SRH are collectively called the
   "RPL artifacts" and can be compressed using <xref target='RFC8138'/>.
   <xref target='u8138'/> presents an example compressed format for a packet
   forwarded by the Root to a RUL in a Storing Mode DODAG.
</t><t>
   The inner packet that is forwarded to the RUL may carry some RPL artifacts,
   e.g., an RPI if the original packet was generated with it, and an SRH in a
   Non-Storing Mode DODAG.
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/> expects the RUL to support the
   basic <xref target='RFC8504'>"IPv6 Node Requirements"</xref>.
   In particular the RUL is expected to ignore the RPL artifacts that are
   either consumed or not applicable to a Host.
   <!--
   Such a host may not necessarily ignore IP-in-IP encapsulation, which is
   dealt with below.
   -->

</t><t>
   A RUL is not expected to support the compression method defined in
   <xref target='RFC8138'/>. For that reason, the border router uncompresses the packet before forwarding over an external route to a RUL <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/>.

<section anchor='lpnd'><name>6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery</name>
<t>
This section goes through the 6LoWPAN ND mechanisms that this specification leverages, as a non-normative reference to the reader.
The full normative text is to be found in <xref target='RFC6775'/>, <xref target='RFC8505'/>, and <xref target='RFC8928'/>.
</t>
<section anchor='R6775'><name>RFC 6775 Address Registration</name>

<t>
   The classical "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) Protocol"
   <xref target='RFC4861'/> <xref target='RFC4862'/> was defined for serial
   links and transit media such as Ethernet. It is a reactive protocol that
   relies heavily on multicast operations for Address Discovery (aka Lookup) and
   Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).
</t><t>
   <xref target='RFC6775'>
   "Neighbor Discovery Optimizations for 6LoWPAN networks"</xref>
   adapts IPv6 ND for operations over energy-constrained LLNs.
   The main functions of <xref target='RFC6775'/> are to proactively establish
   the Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) in the 6LR and to prevent address duplication.
   To that effect, <xref target='RFC6775'/> introduces a new unicast Address
   Registration  mechanism that contributes to reducing the use of multicast
   messages compared to the classical IPv6 ND protocol.

</t><t><xref target='RFC6775'/> defines a new Address
   Registration Option (ARO) that is carried in the unicast
   Neighbor solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages between
   the 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) and the 6LoWPAN Router (6LR).

   It also defines the Duplicate Address Request (DAR) and Duplicate
   Address Confirmation (DAC) messages between the 6LR and the 6LoWPAN Border
   Router (6LBR).
   In an LLN, the 6LBR is the central repository of all the Registered Addresses
   in its domain and the source of truth for uniqueness and ownership.

<section anchor='R8505ER'><name>R Flag</name>
<t>
<xref target='RFC8505'/> introduces the R Flag in the EARO.
   The Registering Node sets the R Flag to indicate whether the 6LR should
   ensure reachability for the Registered Address.
   If the R Flag is set to 0, then the Registering Node handles the reachability
   of the Registered Address by other means. In a RPL network, this means that
   either it is a RAN that injects the route by itself or that it uses another
   RPL Router for reachability services.
</t><t>
   This document specifies how the R Flag is used in the context of RPL.
   A RPL Leaf that implements the 6LN functionality in <xref target='RFC8505'/>
   requires reachability services for an IPv6 address if and only if it sets
   the R Flag in the NS(EARO) used to register the address to a 6LR acting as
   a RPL border Router. Upon receiving the NS(EARO), the RPL Router
   generates a DAO message for the Registered Address if and only if the R
   flag is set to 1.
</t><t>
   <xref target='oper'/> specifies additional operations when R flag is set to 1 in an EARO that is placed either in an NS or an NA message.
</t>

</section> <!-- end section "R Flag" -->
<section anchor='R8505ETID'><name>TID, "I" Field and Opaque Fields</name>

<t>
   When the T Flag is set to 1, the EARO includes a sequence counter called
   Transaction ID (TID), that is needed to fill the Path Sequence Field in the
   RPL Transit Option.
   This is the reason why the support of <xref target='RFC8505'/>
   by the RUL, as opposed to only <xref target='RFC6775'/> is a prerequisite for
   this specification (more in <xref target='prereq6lp'/>). The EARO also
   transports an Opaque field and an associated "I" field that describes what
   the Opaque field transports and how to use it.
</t><t>
   <xref target='ln'/> specifies the use of the "I" field and the Opaque
   field by a RUL.
</t>

</section> <!-- end section "TID, I Field and Opaque Fields" -->
<section anchor='R8505EROVR'><name>ROVR</name>
<t>
   Section 5.3 of <xref target='RFC8505'/> introduces the Registration
   Ownership Verifier (ROVR) field of variable length from 64 to 256 bits.
   The ROVR is a replacement of the EUI-64 in the ARO
   <xref target='RFC6775'/> that was used to identify uniquely an Address
   Registration with the Link-Layer address of the owner but provided no
   protection against spoofing.
</t><t>

   <xref target='RFC8928'>"Address Protected Neighbor Discovery for
   Low-power and Lossy Networks"</xref> leverages the ROVR field as a
   cryptographic proof of ownership to prevent a rogue third party from
   registering an address that is already owned.
   The use of ROVR field enable the 6LR to block traffic that is not sourced at an owned address.
</t><t>

   This specification does not address how the protection by
   <xref target='RFC8928'/> could be extended for use in RPL.
   On the other hand, it adds the ROVR to the DAO to build the proxied EDAR at the Root (see <xref target='tgt'/>), which means that nodes that are aware of the Host route are also aware of the ROVR associated to the Target Address.

<t>
   <xref target='RFC8505'/> updates the DAR/DAC messages into the Extended
   DAR/DAC to carry the ROVR field.
   The EDAR/EDAC exchange takes place
   between the 6LR and the 6LBR. It is triggered by an NS(EARO) message from a 6LN to create, refresh, and delete the corresponding state in the 6LBR.
   The exchange is protected by the retry mechanism (ARQ) specified in 8.2.6 of
   <xref target='RFC6775'/>, though in an LLN, a duration longer than the
   RETRANS_TIMER <xref target='RFC4861'/> of 1 second may be necessary to cover
   the Turn Around Trip delay between the 6LR and the 6LBR.

</t><t>
   RPL <xref target='RFC6550'/> specifies a periodic DAO from the 6LN all the way to
   the Root that maintains the routing state in the RPL network for the lifetime
   indicated by the source of the DAO.
   This means that for each address, there are two keep-alive messages
   that traverse the whole network, one to the Root and one to the 6LBR.
</t><t>

   This specification avoids the periodic EDAR/EDAC exchange across the LLN.
   The 6LR turns
   the periodic NS(EARO) from the RUL into a DAO message to the
   Root on every refresh, but it only generates the EDAR upon the first
   registration, for the purpose of DAD, which must be verified before the
   address is injected in RPL.
   Upon the DAO message, the Root proxies the EDAR exchange to refresh the state at the 6LBR on behalf of the 6LR, as illustrated in <xref target='fReg2'/>.

<t>
   This document provides RPL routing for a RUL. This section describes
   the minimal RPL-independent functionality that the RUL needs to implement to
   obtain routing services for its addresses.
</t>

 <section anchor='prereq6lp'><name>Support of 6LoWPAN ND</name>
<t>
   To obtain routing services from a Router that implements this specification,
   a RUL needs to implement <xref target='RFC8505'/> and set the "R" and "T"
   flags in the EARO to 1 as discussed in <xref target='R8505ER'/> and
   <xref target='R8505EROVR'/>, respectively. <xref target='ln'/> specifies new behaviors for the RUL, e.g., when the R Flag set to 1 in a NS(EARO) is not echoed in the NA(EARO), which indicates that the route injection failed.
</t><t>
   The RUL is expected to request routing services from a Router only if that router originates RA messages with a CIO that has the L, P, and E flags all set to 1
   as discussed in <xref target='R7400'/>, unless configured to do so.
   It is suggested that the RUL also implements
   <xref target='RFC8928'/> to protect the ownership of its addresses.
</t><t>
   A RUL that may attach to multiple 6LRs is expected to prefer those that provide routing services.
   The RUL needs to register to all the 6LRs from which it desires routing services.
</t>
<t>
   Parallel Address Registrations to several 6LRs should be performed in a rapid sequence, using the same EARO for the same Address. Gaps between
   the Address Registrations will invalidate some of the routes till the Address
   Registration finally shows on those routes.
</t>
<t><xref target='RFC8505'/> introduces error Status values in the NA(EARO)
   which can be received synchronously upon an NS(EARO) or asynchronously. The
   RUL needs to support both cases and refrain from using the address
   when the Status value indicates a rejection (see <xref target='stat'/>).

<section anchor='prereqv6ip'><name>Support of IPv6 Encapsulation</name>

   Section 2.1 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/> defines the rules
   for tunneling either to the final destination (e.g., a RUL) or to its
   attachment Router (designated as 6LR). In order to terminate the IP-in-IP
   tunnel, the RUL, as an IPv6 Host, would have to be capable of decapsulating
   the tunneled packet and either drop the encapsulated packet if it is not the
   final destination, or pass it to the upper layer for further processing.
   As indicated in section 4.1 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/>,
   this is not mandated by <xref target='RFC8504'/>, so the Root typically
   terminates the IP-in-IP tunnel at the parent 6LR. It is thus not necessary

<section anchor='upd'><name>Enhancements to RFC 6550</name>
<t>
   This document specifies a new behavior whereby a 6LR injects DAO messages
   for unicast addresses (see <xref target='op'/>) and multicast addresses
   (see <xref target='multiop'/>) on behalf of leaves that are not aware of RPL.
   The RUL addresses are exposed as external targets <xref target='RFC6550'/>.
   Conforming to
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo'/>, an IP-in-IP encapsulation between the 6LR and the RPL Root is used to carry the RPL artifacts and remove them when forwarding outside the RPL domain, e.g., to a RUL.

</t><t>
   This document also synchronizes the liveness monitoring at the Root and the
   6LBR. The same value of lifetime is used for both, and a single keep-alive
   message, the RPL DAO, traverses the RPL network. A new behavior is introduced
   whereby the RPL Root proxies the EDAR message to the 6LBR on behalf of the
   6LR (more in <xref target='upd2'/>), for any Leaf node that implements the
   6LN functionality in <xref target='RFC8505'/>.

</t><t>
   Section 6.7.7 of <xref target='RFC6550'/> introduces the RPL Target Option,
   which can be used in RPL Control messages such as the DAO message to signal a
   destination prefix. This document adds the capabilities to
   transport the ROVR field (see <xref target='R8505EROVR'/>) and the
   IPv6 Address of the prefix advertiser when the Target is a shorter prefix.
   Their use is signaled respectively by a new ROVR Size field being non-zero
   and a new "Advertiser address in Full" 'F' flag set to 1, more in <xref target='tgt'/>.
</t><t>
   This specification defines the new "Root Proxies EDAR/EDAC" (P) flag and
   encodes it in one of these reserved flags of the
   RPL DODAG Configuration option, more in <xref target='pflag'/>.

</t><t>
   The RPL Status defined in section 6.5.1 of <xref target="RFC6550"/>
   for use in the DAO-ACK message is extended to be placed in DCO messages
   <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-efficient-npdao'/> as well. Furthermore, this
   specification enables to carry the EARO Status defined for 6LoWPAN ND
   in RPL DAO and DCO messages, embedded in a RPL Status, more in
   <xref target='stat'/>.

</t><t>
    Section 12 of <xref target='RFC6550'/> details the RPL support for
    multicast flows when the RPLInstance is operated in the MOP of 3
    ("Storing Mode of Operation with multicast support").
    This specification extends the RPL Root operation to proxy-relay the MLDv2 <xref target='RFC3810'/> operation between the RUL and the 6LR, more in <xref target= 'multiop'/>.
</t>


<section anchor='tgt'><name>Updated RPL Target Option</name>
<t> This specification updates the RPL Target Option to transport the ROVR
    that was also defined for 6LoWPAN ND messages.
    This enables the RPL Root to generate the proxied EDAR message to the 6LBR.
   </t>
   <t>
   The new 'F' flag is set to 1 to indicate that the Target Prefix field contains the IPv6 address of the advertising node, in which case the length of the
   Target Prefix field is 128 bits regardless of the value of the Prefix Length field.
   If the 'F' flag is set to 0, the Target Prefix field MUST be aligned to
   the next byte boundary after the size (expressed in bits) indicated by the
   Prefix Length field. Padding bits are reserved and set to 0 per
   section 6.7.7 of <xref target='RFC6550'/>.
   </t>
   <t>
    With this specification the ROVR is the remainder of the RPL Target Option.
    The size of the ROVR is indicated in a new ROVR Size field that is encoded
    to map one-to-one with the Code Suffix in the EDAR message
    (see table 4 of <xref target='RFC8505'/>). The ROVR Size field is taken
    from the flags field, which is an update to the RPL Target Option Flags IANA registry.
   </t>
   <t>
    The updated format is illustrated in <xref target='frpltgt'/>.
    It is backward compatible with the Target Option in
    <xref target='RFC6550'/>.
    It is recommended that the updated format be used as a replacement in new
    implementations in all MOPs in preparation for upcoming Route Ownership Validation mechanisms based on the ROVR, unless the device or the network is
    so constrained that this is not feasible.

   This specification defines a new flag "Root Proxies EDAR/EDAC" (P).
   The 'P' flag is encoded
   in bit position 1 of the reserved Flags in the DODAG Configuration Option (counting from bit 0 as the most significant bit) and it is set to 0 in
   legacy implementations as specified respectively in Sections 20.14 and 6.7.6
   of <xref target='RFC6550'/>.

   is copied unmodified from parents to children.
   <xref target='RFC6550'/> states that "Nodes other than the DODAG Root MUST
   NOT modify this information when propagating the DODAG Configuration option".

    To achieve this, the range of the ARO/EARO Status values is reduced to 0-63, which updates the IANA registry created for <xref target="RFC6775"/>.

<xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-efficient-npdao'/> defines the DCO message for RPL Storing Mode only, with a link-local scope. All nodes in the RPL network are expected to support the specification since the message is processed hop by hop along the path that is being cleaned up.
</t><t>
This specification extends the use of the DCO message to the Non-Storing MOP, whereby the DCO is sent end-to-end by the Root directly to the RAN that injected the DAO message for the considered target.
In that case, intermediate nodes do not need to support <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-efficient-npdao'/>; they forward the DCO message as a plain IPv6 packet between the Root and the RAN.
   </t><t>
In the case of a RUL, the 6LR that serves the RUL acts as the RAN that receives
the Non-Storing DCO.
This specification leverages the Non-Storing DCO between the Root and the 6LR that serves as attachment Router for a RUL. A 6LR and a Root that support this specification MUST implement the Non-Storing DCO.

  <t>
   This specification eliminates the need to exchange keep-alive Extended
   Duplicate Address messages, EDAR and EDAC, all the way from a 6LN to the 6LBR
   across a RPL mesh. Instead, the EDAR/EDAC exchange with the 6LBR is proxied
   by the RPL Root upon the DAO message that refreshes the RPL routing state.
   The first EDAR upon a new Registration cannot be proxied, though, as it
   serves for the purpose of DAD, which must be verified before the address is
   injected in RPL.

 </t><t>
   In a RPL
   network where the function is enabled, refreshing the state in the 6LBR is
   the responsibility of the Root. Consequently, only addresses that are
   injected in RPL will be kept alive at the 6LBR by the RPL Root.
   Since RULs are advertised using Non-Storing Mode, the DAO message flow
   and the keep alive EDAR/EDAC can be nested within the Address
   (re)Registration flow.
   <xref target='fReg1'/> illustrates that, for the first Registration,
   both the DAD and the keep-alive EDAR/EDAC exchanges happen in the same
   sequence.

 <t>
   This flow requires that the lifetimes and sequence counters in 6LoWPAN ND and RPL are aligned.
   </t><t>
   To achieve this, the Path
   Sequence and the Path Lifetime in the DAO message are taken from the
   Transaction ID and the Address Registration lifetime in the NS(EARO) message
   from the 6LN.


</t><t>
   On the first Address Registration, illustrated in <xref target='fReg1'/>
   for RPL Non-Storing Mode, the Extended Duplicate Address exchange takes place
   as prescribed by <xref target='RFC8505'/>. If the exchange fails, the 6LR returns an NA message with a negative status to the 6LN, the NCE is not created, and the address is not injected in RPL.

   Otherwise, the 6LR creates an NCE and injects the Registered
   Address in the RPL routing using a DAO/DAO-ACK exchange with the RPL DODAG
   Root.
</t>
 <t>
    An Address Registration refresh is performed by the 6LN to maintain the NCE
    in the 6LR alive before the lifetime expires. Upon the refresh of a
    registration, the 6LR reinjects the corresponding route in RPL before it expires, as illustrated in <xref target='fReg2'/>.

    This is what causes the RPL Root to refresh the state in the 6LBR, using an
    EDAC message.
    In case of an error in the proxied EDAR flow, the error is
    returned in the DAO-ACK using a RPL Status with the 'A' flag set to 1 that imbeds
    a 6LoWPAN Status value as discussed in <xref target='stat'/>.

 </t> <t>

    The 6LR may receive a requested DAO-ACK after it received an asynchronous
    Non-Storing DCO, but the negative Status in the DCO supersedes a positive
    Status in the DAO-ACK regardless of the order in which they are received.
    Upon the DAO-ACK - or the DCO if one arrives first - the 6LR responds to the
    RUL with an NA(EARO).

 </t> <t>
   An issue may be detected later, e.g., the address moves to a different
   DODAG with the 6LBR attached to a different 6LoWPAN Backbone Router (6BBR),
   see Figure 5 in section 3.3 of <xref target='RFC8929'/>.
   The 6BBR may send a negative ND status, e.g., in an asynchronous NA(EARO)
   to the 6LBR.
 </t> <t>
   <xref target='RFC8929'/> expects that the 6LBR is collocated with the RPL Root,  but if not, the 6LBR MUST forward the status code to the originator of the EDAR, either the 6LR or the RPL Root that proxies for it.
   The ND status code is mapped in a RPL Status value by the RPL Root, and then back by the 6LR.
</t><t>

   <xref target='fReg1.5'/> illustrates this in the case where the 6LBR and the Root are not collocated, and the Root proxies the EDAR messages.

 <t>

   If the Root does not proxy, then the EDAC with a negative status reaches the
   6LR directly. In that case, the 6LR MUST clean up the route using a DAO with
   a Lifetime of zero, and it MUST propagate the status back to the RUL in a NA(EARO) with the R Flag set to 0.
 </t><t>
    The RUL may terminate the registration at any time by using a Registration
    Lifetime of 0.
    This specification requires that the RPL Target Option transports the ROVR.
    This way, the same flow as the heartbeat flow is sufficient to inform the
    6LBR using the Root as proxy, as illustrated in <xref target="fReg2"/>.

 </t> <t>
    Any combination of the logical functions of 6LR, Root, and 6LBR might be

<section anchor='oper'><name>Detailed Operation</name>


<section anchor='ln'><name>Perspective of the 6LN Acting as RUL</name>
<t>
  This specification does not alter the operation of a 6LoWPAN ND-compliant
  6LN/RUL, which is expected to operate as follows:
</t>
<ol spacing='normal'>
<li>
    The 6LN selects a 6LR that provides reachability services for a RUL. This
    is signaled a 6CIO in the RA messages with the L, P and E flags set to 1
    as prescribed by <xref target='RFC8505'/>.
</li><li>
   The 6LN obtains an IPv6 global address, either using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) <xref target='RFC4862'/> based on a Prefix
   Information Option (PIO) <xref target='RFC4861'/> found in an RA message, or
   some other means, such as DHCPv6 <xref target='RFC8415'/>.

</li><li>
   Once it has formed an address, the 6LN registers its address and refreshes its registration periodically, early enough
   within the Lifetime of the previous Address Registration, as prescribed by
   <xref target='RFC6775'/>, to refresh the NCE before the lifetime indicated
   in the EARO expires. It sets the T Flag to 1 as prescribed in <xref target='RFC8505'/>.
   The TID is incremented each time and wraps in a lollipop fashion (see
   section 5.2.1 of <xref target='RFC8505'/>, which is fully compatible with
   section 7.2 of <xref target='RFC6550'/>).
</li><li>
   As stated in section 5.2 of <xref target='RFC8505'/>, the 6LN can register
   to more than one 6LR at the same time. In that case, it
   uses the same EARO for all of the parallel Address Registrations, with the exception of the Registration Lifetime field and the setting of the R flag that may differ.

   The 6LN may cancel a subset of its registrations, or transfer a
   registration from one or more old 6LR(s) to one or more new 6LR(s). To do
   so, the 6LN sends a series of NS(EARO) messages, all with the same TID,
   with a zero Registration Lifetime to the old 6LR(s) and
   with a non-zero Registration Lifetime to the new 6LR(s). In that process,
   the 6LN SHOULD send the NS(EARO) with a non-zero Registration Lifetime and
   ensure that at least one succeeds before it sends an NS(EARO) that
   terminates another registration. This avoids the churn related to transient
   route invalidation in the RPL network above the common parent of the
   involved 6LRs.
<!--

   To avoid churn related to transient route invalidation, the 6LN
   SHOULD send the NS(EARO) to maintain the registration active (i.e., with a
   non-zero Registration Lifetime)
-->


</li><li>
<!--
   Following section 5.1 of <xref target='RFC8505'/>,
   a 6LN acting as a RUL sets the R Flag in the EARO of its registration(s)
   for which it requires routing services. If the R Flag is not echoed in the
   NA, the RUL SHOULD attempt to use another 6LR. The RUL SHOULD send the
   registration(s) with the R Flag set to 1 and ensure that one succeeds
   before it sends the registrations with the flag set to 0. In case of a conflict
   with the preceding rule on lifetime, the rule on lifetime has precedence.
-->

  Following section 5.1 of <xref target='RFC8505'/>,
  a 6LN acting as a RUL sets the R Flag in the EARO of its registration(s)
  for which it requires routing services. If the R Flag is not echoed in the
  NA, the RUL SHOULD attempt to use another 6LR.  The RUL SHOULD ensure that one registration succeeds before setting the R Flag to 0.  In case of a
  conflict
  with the preceding rule on lifetime, the rule on lifetime has precedence.

</li><li>
   The 6LN may use any of the 6LRs to which it registered as the default
   gateway.
   Using a 6LR to which the 6LN is not registered may result in packets dropped
   at the 6LR by a Source Address Validation function (SAVI) <xref target='RFC7039'/> so it is not recommended.
</li>

</ol>

<t>
   Even without support for RPL, the RUL may be configured with an opaque value
   to be provided to the routing protocol. If the RUL has knowledge of the RPL
   Instance the packet should be injected into, then it SHOULD set the Opaque
   field in the EARO to the RPLInstanceID, else it MUST leave the Opaque field
   to zero.
</t>
<t>
   Regardless of the setting of the Opaque field, the 6LN MUST set the "I"
   field to zero to signal "topological information to be passed to a routing
   process", as specified in section 5.1 of <xref target='RFC8505'/>.
</t><t>
   A RUL is not expected to produce RPL artifacts in the data packets, but it
   may do so. For instance, if the RUL has minimal awareness of the RPL
   Instance then it can build an RPI. A RUL that places an RPI in a data packet
   SHOULD indicate the RPLInstanceID of the RPL Instance where the
   packet should be forwarded. It is up to the 6LR (e.g., by policy) to use the
   RPLInstanceID information provided by the RUL or rewrite it to the selected
   RPLInstanceID for forwarding inside the RPL domain.
   All the flags and the Rank field are set
   to 0 as specified by section 11.2 of <xref target='RFC6550'/>.
</t>
</section>




<section anchor='lr'><name>Perspective of the 6LR Acting as Border Router</name>

<t>
    A 6LR that provides reachability services for a RUL in a RPL network
    as specified in this document MUST include a 6CIO in its RA messages and
    set the L, P and E flags to 1 as prescribed by <xref target='RFC8505'/>.
</t><t>
   As prescribed by <xref target='RFC8505'/>,
   the 6LR generates an EDAR message upon reception of a valid NS(EARO)
   message for the registration of a new IPv6 address by a 6LN.
   If the initial EDAR/EDAC exchange succeeds, then the 6LR installs an NCE
   for the Registration Lifetime. For the registration refreshes, if the RPL Root has indicated that it proxies the keep-alive EDAR/EDAC exchange with the 6LBR (see <xref target='upd'/>), the 6LR MUST refrain from sending the keep-alive EDAR.
</t>
<t>
   If the R Flag is set to 1 in the NS(EARO), the 6LR SHOULD inject the
   Host route in RPL, unless this is barred for other reasons, such as the saturation of the RPL parents. The 6LR MUST use a RPL Non-Storing Mode
   signaling and the updated Target Option (see <xref target='tgt'/>). The 6LR MUST request a DAO-ACK by setting the 'K' flag in the DAO message. Success
   injecting the route to the RUL's address is indicated by the 'E' flag
   set to 0 in the RPL status of the DAO-ACK message.
</t>


 <t>
   The Opaque field in the EARO provides a mean to signal which RPL Instance is to be used for the DAO advertisements and the forwarding of packets sourced at the Registered Address when there is no RPI in the packet.
</t> <t>
   As described in <xref target='RFC8505'/>, if the "I" field is zero, then the Opaque field is expected to carry the RPLInstanceID suggested by the 6LN; otherwise, there is no suggested Instance.
   If the 6LR participates in the suggested RPL Instance, then the
   6LR MUST use that RPL Instance for the Registered Address.
</t> <t>
   If there is no suggested RPL Instance or else if the 6LR does not participate to the suggested Instance, it is expected that the packets coming from the 6LN "can unambiguously be associated to at least one RPL Instance" <xref target='RFC6550'/> by the 6LR, e.g., using a policy that
   maps the 6-tuple into an Instance.
</t>
<t>
  The DAO message advertising the Registered Address MUST be constructed as
  follows:
  </t>
<ol spacing='normal'>
  <li>The Registered Address is signaled as the Target Prefix in the updated Target Option in the DAO message; the Prefix Length is set to 128 but the 'F' flag is set to 0 since the advertiser is not the RUL. The ROVR field is copied unchanged from the EARO (see <xref target='tgt'/>).
  </li><li>
  The 6LR indicates one of its global or unique-local IPv6 unicast addresses as the Parent Address in the RPL Transit Information Option (TIO) associated with the Target Option
  </li><li>
  The 6LR sets the External 'E' flag in the TIO to indicate that it is redistributing
  an external target into the RPL network

  </li><li>
  <t>
  the Path Lifetime in the TIO is computed from the Registration Lifetime in the EARO. This operation converts seconds to the Lifetime Units used in the RPL operation. This creates the deployment constraint that the Lifetime Unit is reasonably compatible with the expression of the Registration Lifetime. e.g., a Lifetime Unit of 0x4000 maps the most significant byte of the Registration Lifetime to the Path Lifetime.
    </t>  <t>
  In that operation, the Path Lifetime must be rounded, if needed, to the upper value to ensure that the path has a longer lifetime than the registration.
    </t>  <t>
  Note that if the Registration Lifetime is 0, then the Path Lifetime is also 0 and the DAO message becomes a No-Path DAO, which cleans up the routes down to the RUL's address; this also causes the Root as a proxy to send an EDAR message to the 6LBR with a Lifetime of 0.
  </t>
  </li><li>
  the Path Sequence in the TIO is set to the TID value found in the EARO option.
  </li>

</ol>

<t>

   Upon receiving or timing out the DAO-ACK after an implementation-specific number of retries, the 6LR MUST send the corresponding NA(EARO) to the RUL. Upon receiving an asynchronous DCO message, if a DAO-ACK is pending then the 6LR MUST wait for the DAO-ACK to send the NA(EARO) and deliver the status found in the DCO, else it MUST send an asynchronous NA(EARO) to the RUL immediately.

</t><t>
   The 6LR MUST set the R Flag to 1 in the NA(EARO) back if and only if the 'E' flag is set to 0, indicating that the 6LR injected the Registered Address in the RPL routing successfully and that the EDAR proxy operation succeeded.
</t><t>

   If the 'A' flag in the RPL Status is set to 1, the embedded Status value is passed
   back to the RUL in the EARO Status.
   If the 'E' flag is also set to 1, the registration failed for
   6LoWPAN ND related reasons, and the NCE is removed.
</t><t>

   An error injecting the route causes the 'E' flag to be set to 1. If the error is not related to ND, the 'A' flag is set to 0. In that case, the registration succeeds, but the RPL route is not installed. So the NA(EARO) is returned
   with a positive status but the R Flag set to 0, which means that the 6LN
   obtained a binding but no route.
</t><t>
   If the 'A' flag is set to 0 in the RPL Status of the DAO-ACK, then the 6LoWPAN
   ND operation succeeded, and an EARO Status of 0 (Success) MUST be returned to
   the 6LN. The EARO Status of 0 MUST also be used if the 6LR did not attempt to inject the route but could create the binding after a successful EDAR/EDAC exchange or refresh it.
</t><t>
   If the 'E' flag is set to 1 in the RPL Status of the DAO-ACK, then the route was not installed and the R flag MUST be set to 0 in the NA(EARO). The R flag MUST be set to 0 if the 6LR did not attempt to inject the route.

</t><t>
   In a network where Address Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND) is enabled,
   in case of a DAO-ACK or a DCO indicating transporting an EARO
   Status value of 5 (Validation Requested), the 6LR MUST
   challenge the 6LN for ownership of the address, as described in section
   6.1 of <xref target='RFC8928'/>, before the Registration is
   complete. This flow, illustrated in <xref target='Dynamic-fig'/>, ensures that the address is validated before it is injected in the RPL routing.
</t><t>
   If the challenge succeeds, then the operations continue as normal.
   In particular, a DAO message is generated
   upon the NS(EARO) that proves the ownership of the address. If the challenge
   failed, the 6LR rejects the registration as prescribed by AP-ND and may take
   actions to protect itself against DoS attacks by a rogue 6LN, see
   <xref target='security-considerations'/>.

<t>
   The 6LR may at any time send a unicast asynchronous NA(EARO) with the R Flag set to 0 to signal that it stops providing routing services, and/or with the EARO Status 2 "Neighbor Cache full" to signal that it removes the NCE. It may also send a final RA, unicast or multicast, with a Router Lifetime field of zero, to signal that it stops serving as Router, as specified in section 6.2.5 of <xref target='RFC4861'/>. This may happen upon a
   DCO or a DAO-ACK message indicating the path is already removed; else the
   6LR MUST remove the Host route to the 6LN using a DAO message with a Path
   Lifetime of zero.
</t><t>

   A valid NS(EARO) message with the R Flag set to 0 and a Registration Lifetime that is not zero signals that the 6LN wishes to maintain the binding but does not require the routing services from the 6LR (any more).

   Upon this message, if, due to previous NS(EARO) with the R Flag set to 1, the
   6LR was injecting the Host route to the Registered Address in RPL using DAO
   messages, then the 6LR MUST invalidate the Host route in RPL using a DAO
   with a Path Lifetime of zero.

   It is up to the Registering 6LN to maintain the corresponding route from then
   on, either keeping it active via a different 6LR or by acting as a RAN and
   managing its own reachability.

</t>


</section>

<section anchor='Root'><name>Perspective of the RPL Root</name>

<t>
   A RPL Root MUST set the 'P' flag to 1 in the RPL DODAG Configuration Option of
   the DIO messages that it generates (see <xref target='upd'/>) to signal
   that it proxies the EDAR/EDAC exchange and supports the Updated RPL Target
   option.
   <!-- The remainder of this section assumes that it does. -->

</t><t>
   Upon reception of a DAO message, for each updated RPL Target Option
   (see <xref target='tgt'/>) that creates or updates an existing RPL state, the Root MUST notify the 6LBR by using a proxied EDAR/EDAC exchange. If
   if the RPL Root and the 6LBR are integrated, an internal API can be used.


</t>


  <t>
  The EDAR message MUST be constructed as follows:
  </t>
<ol spacing='normal'>
  <li>
  The Target IPv6 address from the RPL Target Option is placed in the
  Registered Address field of the EDAR message;
  <!--and in the Target field of the NS message, respectively-->
  </li><li>
  the Registration Lifetime is adapted from the Path Lifetime in the TIO by
  converting the Lifetime Units used in RPL into units of 60 seconds used in the
  6LoWPAN ND messages;
  </li><li>
  <!--
  the RPL Root indicates its own MAC address as Source Link Layer Address (SLLA)
  in the NS(EARO);
  </li><li>
  -->
  the TID value is set to the Path Sequence in the TIO and indicated with an ICMP
  code of 1 in the EDAR message;
  </li><li>
  The ROVR in the RPL Target Option is copied as is in the
  EDAR and the ICMP Code Suffix is set to the appropriate value as shown in
  Table 4 of <xref target='RFC8505'/> depending on the size of the ROVR field.
  </li>
</ol>

<t>
   Upon receiving an EDAC message from the 6LBR, if a DAO is pending, then the
   Root MUST send a DAO-ACK back to the 6LR. Else, if the Status in the EDAC message is not "Success", then it MUST send an asynchronous DCO to the 6LR.
</t>
<t>
   In either case, the EDAC Status is embedded in the RPL Status with the 'A'
   flag set to 1.
</t>
<t>
   The proxied EDAR/EDAC exchange MUST be protected with a timer of an appropriate duration and a number of retries, that are implementation-dependent, and SHOULD be configurable since the Root and the 6LBR are typically nodes with a higher capacity and manageability than 6LRs.
   Upon timing out, the Root MUST send an error back to the 6LR as above, either using a DAO-ACK or a DCO, as appropriate, with the 'A' and 'E' flags set to 1 in the RPL status, and a RPL Status value of of "6LBR Registry Saturated" <xref target='RFC8505'/>.

</t>

</section>

<section anchor='lbr'><name>Perspective of the 6LBR</name>

<t>
  The 6LBR is unaware that the RPL Root is not the new attachment 6LR of the RUL,
  so it is not impacted by this specification.
</t>

<t>
   Upon reception of an EDAR message,
   the 6LBR acts as prescribed by <xref target='RFC8505'/> and returns an EDAC message to the sender.
</t>

<section anchor='multiop'><name>Protocol Operations for Multicast Addresses</name>

 <t> Section 12 of <xref target='RFC6550'/> details the RPL support for
    multicast flows. This support is activated by the MOP of 3 ("Storing Mode of Operation with multicast support") in the DIO messages that form the DODAG. This section also applies if and only if the MOP of the RPLInstance is 3.
 </t>
 <t>
    The RPL support of multicast is not source-specific and only operates as
    an extension to the Storing Mode of Operation for unicast packets.
    Note that
    it is the RPL model that the multicast packet is passed as a Layer-2 unicast
    to each of the interested children.
    This remains true when forwarding between the 6LR and the listener 6LN.
 </t>
 <t>
    <xref target='RFC3810'>
    "Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6"</xref> provides an
    interface for a listener to register to multicast flows.
    In the MLD model, the Router is a "querier", and the Host is a multicast
    listener that registers to the querier to obtain copies of the particular
    flows it is interested in.


 </t><t>
     The equivalent of the first Address Registration happens as illustrated in <xref target='fReg3'/>. The 6LN, as an MLD listener, sends an unsolicited Report to the 6LR. This enables it to start receiving the flow immediately, and causes the 6LR to inject the multicast route in RPL.

 </t>
 <t> This specification does not change MLD but will operate more efficiently
     if the asynchronous messages for unsolicited Report and Done are sent by
     the 6LN as Layer-2 unicast to the 6LR, in particular on wireless.
 </t><t>
     The 6LR acts as a generic MLD querier and generates a DAO with the Multicast Address as the Target Prefix as described in section 12 of <xref target='RFC6550'/>. As for the Unicast Host routes, the Path Lifetime associated to the Target is mapped from the Query Interval, and set to be larger to account for variable propagation delays to the Root.
     The Root proxies the MLD exchange as a listener with the 6LBR acting as the
     querier, so as to get packets from a source external to the RPL domain.

 </t><t>
     Upon a DAO with a Target option for a multicast address, the RPL Root checks if it is already registered as a listener for that address, and if not, it performs its own unsolicited Report for the multicast address as described in section 5.1 of <xref target='RFC3810'/>.
     The report is source independent, so there is no Source Address listed.

 <t>
    The equivalent of the registration refresh is pulled periodically by the 6LR acting as querier.

    Upon the timing out of the Query Interval, the 6LR sends a Multicast Address Specific Query to each of its listeners, for each Multicast Address, and gets a Report back that is mapped into a DAO one by one.
    Optionally, the 6LR MAY send a General Query, where the Multicast Address field is set to zero. In that case, the multicast packet is passed as a Layer-2 unicast to each of the interested children.
.


 </t>
 <t>
    Upon a Report, the 6LR generates a DAO with as many Target Options as there are Multicast Address Records in the Report message, copying the
    Multicast Address field in the Target Prefix of the RPL Target Option.
    The DAO message is a Storing Mode DAO, passed to a selection of the 6LR's
    parents.

 </t>
 <t>
    Asynchronously to this, a similar procedure happens between the Root and a router such as the 6LBR that serves multicast flows on the Link where the Root is located. Again the Query and Report messages are source independent. The Root lists exactly once each Multicast Address for which it has at least one active multicast DAO state, copying the multicast address in the DAO state in the Multicast Address field of the
    Multicast Address Records in the Report message.

</section>




<section anchor='security-considerations'><name>Security Considerations</name>
 <t>
   It is worth noting that with <xref target='RFC6550'/>, every
   node in the LLN is RPL-aware and can inject any RPL-based attack in the
   network. This specification isolates edge nodes that can only interact with
   the RPL Routers using 6LoWPAN ND, meaning that they cannot perform RPL
   insider attacks.
 </t>
 <t>
	The LLN nodes depend on the 6LBR and the RPL participants for their
    operation.
	A trust model must be put in place to ensure that the right devices are
	acting in these roles, so as to avoid threats such as black-holing,
        (see <xref target='RFC7416'/> section 7),
    Denial-Of-Service attacks whereby a rogue 6LR creates a high churn in the RPL network by advertising and removing many forged addresses,
	or bombing attack whereby an impersonated 6LBR would destroy state in
	the network by using the status code of 4 ("Removed").


 </t><t>
    This trust model could be
    at a minimum based on a Layer-2 Secure joining and the Link-Layer security.
    This is a generic 6LoWPAN requirement, see Req5.1 in Appendix of <xref target='RFC8505'/>.
 </t><t>
    In a general manner, the Security Considerations in
    <xref target='RFC7416'/> <xref target='RFC6775'/>, and <xref target='RFC8505'/> apply to this specification as well.
 </t><t>
    The Link-Layer security is needed in particular to prevent
    Denial-Of-Service attacks whereby a rogue 6LN creates a high churn in the
    RPL network by constantly registering and deregistering addresses with the
    R Flag set to 1 in the EARO.

 </t> <t>
   <xref target='RFC8928'/> updated 6LoWPAN ND with the called Address-Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND). AP-ND protects the owner of an address against address theft and impersonation attacks in a Low-Power and Lossy Network (LLN). Nodes supporting th extension compute a cryptographic identifier (Crypto-ID), and use it with one or more of their Registered Addresses. The Crypto-ID identifies the owner of the Registered Address and can be used to provide proof of ownership of the Registered Addresses. Once an address is registered with the Crypto-ID and a proof of ownership is provided, only the owner of that address can modify the registration information, thereby enforcing Source Address Validation.
   <xref target='RFC8928'/>
   reduces even more the attack perimeter that is available to the edge nodes
   and its use is suggested in this specification.
 </t><t>
    Additionally, the trust model could include a role validation
    to ensure that the node that claims to be a 6LBR or a RPL Root is entitled
    to do so.
 </t><t>
    The Opaque field in the EARO enables the RUL to suggest a RPLInstanceID
    where its traffic is placed. It is also possible for an attacker RUL to
    include an RPI in the packet. This opens to attacks where a RPL instance
    would be reserved for critical traffic, e.g., with a specific bandwidth
    reservation, that the additional traffic generated by a rogue may disrupt.
    The attack may be alleviated by traditional access control and traffic
    shaping mechanisms where the 6LR controls the incoming traffic from the
    6LN. More importantly, the 6LR is the node that injects the traffic in the
    RPL domain, so it has the final word on which RPLInstance is to be used
    for the traffic coming from the RUL, per its own policy.
 </t><t>
    At the time of this writing, RPL does not have a Route Ownership Validation
    model whereby it is possible to validate the origin of an address that is
    injected in a DAO.
    This specification makes a first step in that direction by
    allowing the Root to challenge the RUL via the 6LR that serves it.

 </t><t>
   <xref target='tgt'/> indicates that when the length of the ROVR field is unknown, the RPL Target Option must be passed on as received in RPL storing Mode. This creates a possible opening for using DAO messages as a
   covert channel. Note that DAO messages are rare and the overusing that channel could be detected. An implementation SHOULD notify the network
   management when a RPL Target Option is receives with an unknown ROVR field size, to ensure that the situation is known to the network administrator.
 </t><t>
     <xref target='I-D.ietf-roll-efficient-npdao'/> introduces the ability for
     a rogue common ancestor node to invalidate a route on behalf of the target
     node. In this case, the RPL Status in the DCO has the 'A' flag set to 0, and a NA(EARO) is returned to the 6LN with the R flag set to 0. This encourages the 6LN to try another 6LR. If a 6LR exists that does not use
     the rogue common ancestor, then the 6LN will eventually succeed gaining
     reachability over the RPL network in spite of the rogue node.

<section anchor='u8138'><name>Example Compression</name>

 <t>

 <xref target='rtghc'/> illustrates the case in Storing Mode where the packet
    is received from the Internet, then the Root encapsulates the packet to
    insert the RPI and deliver to the 6LR that is the parent and last hop to the
    final destination, which is not known to support <xref target='RFC8138'/>.

    </t>

        ]]></artwork></figure>

    <t>
    The difference with the example presented in Figure 19 of
    <xref target='RFC8138'/> is the addition of a SRH-6LoRH before the RPI-6LoRH
    to transport the compressed address of the 6LR as the destination address of
    the outer IPv6 header. In the <xref target='RFC8138'/> example the destination IP of the
    outer header was elided and was implicitly the same address as the
    destination of the inner header.

    Type 1 was arbitrarily chosen, and the size of 0 denotes a single address in
    the SRH.
    </t>
    <t>
     In <xref target='rtghc'/>, the source of the IP-in-IP encapsulation is
          the Root, so it is elided in the IP-in-IP 6LoRH. The destination is
          the parent 6LR of the destination of the encapsulated packet so it
          cannot be elided. If the DODAG is operated in Storing Mode, it is the
          single entry in the SRH-6LoRH and the SRH-6LoRH Size is encoded as 0.
          The SRH-6LoRH is the first 6LoRH in the chain.
          In this particular example, the 6LR address can
          be compressed to 2 bytes so a Type of 1 is used.
          It results that the total length of the SRH-6LoRH is 4 bytes.

       </t>
    <t>
          In Non-Storing Mode, the encapsulation from the Root would be similar
          to that represented in <xref target='rtghc'/> with possibly more hops
          in the SRH-6LoRH and possibly multiple SRH-6LoRHs if the various
          addresses in the routing header are not compressed to the same format.
          Note that on the last hop to the parent 6LR, the RH3 is consumed and
          removed from the compressed form, so the use of Non-Storing Mode vs.
          Storing Mode is indistinguishable from the packet format.
       </t>
    <t>
          The SRH-6LoRHs are followed by RPI-6LoRH and then the IP-in-IP 6LoRH.
          When the IP-in-IP 6LoRH is removed, all the 6LoRH Headers that
          precede it are also removed.
          The Paging Dispatch <xref target='RFC8025'/> may also be removed if
          there was no previous Page change to a Page other than 0 or 1, since
          the LOWPAN_IPHC is encoded in the same fashion in the default Page 0
          and in Page 1. The resulting packet to the destination is the
          encapsulated packet compressed with <xref target='RFC6282'/>.
